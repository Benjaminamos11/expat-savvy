# üìß Email Nurture System - Complete Documentation

## üéØ Overview

The email nurture system automatically sends a sequence of follow-up emails to leads who request quotes but don't book a consultation. The sequence stops immediately when a lead books through Cal.com.

## üöÄ Frontend Integration

### Forms that trigger the email sequence:

All forms that use the "Get 3 Offers" flow should call the backend API.

#### Implementation in `public/scripts/offers-modal.js`:

```javascript
async submitToBackendAPI(formData) {
    try {
        const leadData = {
            name: formData.get('name'),
            email: formData.get('email'),
            phone: formData.get('phone'),
            city: formData.get('city'),
            consent_marketing: formData.get('consent_marketing') === 'on',
            stage: 'new',
            flow: 'quote',
            channel: this.attributionData.channel || 'organic',
            // ... other fields
        };

        const response = await fetch('https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(leadData)
        });

        if (response.ok) {
            console.log('‚úÖ Lead created and welcome email sent');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('‚ùå Error creating lead:', error);
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### 1. Test Welcome Email
```bash
curl -X POST https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "consent_marketing": true,
    "stage": "new",
    "flow": "quote"
  }'
```

### 2. Test All 3 Emails
```bash
curl -X POST https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/email/test-all-emails
```
*This sends all 3 emails to bw@expat-savvy.ch with 1-second delays*

### 3. Test Booking Webhook
```bash
curl -X POST https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/test/simulate-booking
```
*This simulates a Cal.com booking for bw@expat-savvy.ch*

### 4. Test Cron Job
```bash
curl https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/email/process-nurture
```
*Manually trigger the nurture email processor*

## üìä Monitoring

### Check System Status:

1. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   fly logs
   ```

2. **Check lead status in Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM leads_with_appointments 
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

3. **Check email sent timestamps:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, name, stage, 
          email_welcome_sent_at,
          email_day1_sent_at,
          email_day3_sent_at,
          email_sequence_status
   FROM leads 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Check appointments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM appointments 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Key Metrics to Track:

- **Welcome Email Delivery Rate**: Check `email_welcome_sent_at` is not null
- **Day 1 Email Send Rate**: Leads with 24+ hours and `email_day1_sent_at` set
- **Day 3 Email Send Rate**: Leads with 72+ hours and `email_day3_sent_at` set
- **Booking Conversion Rate**: Leads with `stage = 'booked'`
- **Email Stop Rate**: Leads with `email_sequence_status = 'stopped'`

## üîí Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables (Fly.io Secrets):

```bash
EMAIL_API_KEY=re_...              # Resend API key
EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend             # Email service provider
FROM_EMAIL=hello@expat-savvy.ch  # From email address
CAL_LINK=https://cal.com/robertkolar/expat-savvy  # Cal.com booking link
SUPABASE_URL=https://...         # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...    # Supabase service role key
```

### Update Secrets:
```bash
fly secrets set EMAIL_API_KEY="your-new-key"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Welcome email not sent
**Check:**
1. Is the form calling the backend API? (Check browser console)
2. Is the API responding? Test with curl
3. Check Fly.io logs: `fly logs | grep "Welcome"`
4. Verify Resend API key: `fly secrets list`

### Problem: Day 1/Day 3 emails not sent
**Check:**
1. Is the cron job running? Check cron-job.org dashboard
2. Are leads in the queue? Check Supabase: `SELECT * FROM leads WHERE email_sequence_status = 'active'`
3. Check if leads are old (before Oct 9, 2025) - they are intentionally skipped
4. Check logs: `fly logs | grep "Processing.*leads"`

### Problem: Webhook not stopping email sequence
**Check:**
1. Is webhook configured in Cal.com? Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Test webhook: Use Cal.com ping test
3. Check logs: `fly logs | grep "calcom"`
4. Verify lead was found: Check for "Stopped nurture sequence" in logs

### Problem: Emails going to spam
**Solutions:**
1. Add SPF/DKIM records for your domain in Resend
2. Warm up your sending domain
3. Ask recipients to whitelist hello@expat-savvy.ch

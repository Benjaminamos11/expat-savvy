    text: "I was advised by Robert Kolar who gave me excellent advice regarding health insurance in Switzerland. As a citizen of the United States, the Swiss system of healthcare was very confusing and difficult for me to figure it out on my own. After the initial consultation, everything was much clearer and I was able to take steps in the right direction. I highly recommend Expat Savvy Consulting.",

faq:
  - q: "Is Helsana good for expats?"
    a: "Helsana offers English-language support in major cities and has a well-developed digital app (Helsana+). However, premiums can be higher in certain regions compared to budget insurers. We help you compare whether Helsana's service quality justifies the price difference for your specific canton and situation."
  - q: "Can I switch to Helsana from another insurer?"
    a: "Yes, you can switch to Helsana during the annual switching period (deadline 30 November for basic insurance). For basic insurance, Helsana must accept you. For supplementary insurance, they conduct a health check and may reject or exclude pre-existing conditions."
  - q: "What's the difference between Helsana's basic and supplementary plans?"
    a: "Basic insurance (LAMal/KVG) is mandatory and identical across all insurers by law — only price and service differ. Supplementary insurance (Completa, Top, Primeo) is optional and covers extras like dental, private hospital rooms, alternative medicine, and worldwide coverage. We help you choose the right combination."
  - q: "How strict is Helsana with pre-existing conditions?"
    a: "For basic insurance, Helsana must accept everyone regardless of health history. For supplementary insurance, Helsana is relatively strict and requires detailed health questionnaires. We help structure applications to maximize approval chances and can check acceptance likelihood before formal submission."
  - q: "How can I compare Helsana with other providers?"
    a: "We provide independent comparisons across all major Swiss insurers including Helsana, CSS, Swica, Sanitas, and 50+ others. We assess premiums, acceptance rates, service quality, English support, and claims processing — not just prices."
  - q: "Does Helsana offer group discounts for expats?"
    a: "Helsana offers corporate group plans for employers. As independent brokers, we also have access to broker-negotiated group rates for supplementary insurance across multiple insurers. We verify which discounts you qualify for during consultation."

metaDescription: "Helsana: 2.2M clients, Helsana+ wellness app, fast claims processing. English hotline available. Strict supplementary acceptance. Group discounts possible. Independent review."

faq:
  - q: "Is Atupri good for expats?"
    a: "Atupri is excellent for budget optimization but has no English customer service. We recommend it for expats comfortable with German or French, or when we provide ongoing broker support to bridge the language gap."
  - q: "Is Atupri the cheapest health insurance in Switzerland?"
    a: "Atupri frequently offers the lowest or near-lowest premiums, especially with HMO models and high deductibles. However, 'cheapest' varies by canton, age, and model — we compare all options."
  - q: "Does Atupri have English customer service?"
    a: "No, Atupri does not offer English customer service. Service is available in German, French, and Italian only. As your broker, we handle communications in English and coordinate with Atupri on your behalf."
  - q: "Can I trust Atupri with my health insurance?"
    a: "Yes, Atupri has operated since 1930 and is a legitimate Swiss health insurer. Their focus is on cost efficiency rather than premium service, which explains the lower premiums and more basic support."
  - q: "What's the catch with Atupri's low premiums?"
    a: "There's no catch — Atupri operates efficiently and passes savings to clients. The trade-off is more basic customer service (no English, fewer frills) compared to larger insurers. For budget-conscious clients, this is often an acceptable trade."
  - q: "Can I switch to Atupri from another insurer?"
    a: "Yes, you can switch to Atupri during the annual switching period (deadline 30 November). Basic insurance acceptance is guaranteed. We handle the switching process in English."

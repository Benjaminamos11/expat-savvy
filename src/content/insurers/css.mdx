faq:
  - q: "Is CSS good for expats?"
    a: "CSS offers competitive premiums and solid service, though English support availability varies by region. We help assess whether CSS is the best fit for your canton and needs, comparing it with other major insurers."
  - q: "Can I switch to CSS from another insurer?"
    a: "Yes, you can switch to CSS during the annual switching period (deadline 30 November for basic insurance). For basic insurance, CSS must accept you. Supplementary insurance requires health questionnaires."
  - q: "Is CSS cheaper than Helsana or SWICA?"
    a: "It depends on your canton and chosen model. In some regions CSS has very competitive premiums, while in others it's similar to competitors. We provide exact comparisons for your specific location."
  - q: "What are CSS's myFlex models?"
    a: "myFlex is CSS's alternative insurance model offering premium savings (10-20%) in exchange for coordinated care through designated providers. We help determine if it fits your healthcare usage pattern."
  - q: "How strict is CSS with pre-existing conditions?"
    a: "For basic insurance, CSS must accept everyone. For supplementary insurance, they conduct health checks and may exclude conditions or load premiums. We help maximize acceptance through strategic application."
  - q: "Does CSS have good customer service?"
    a: "CSS generally receives good customer satisfaction ratings (4.3/5). Service quality can vary by region. We consider this alongside premiums when recommending insurers."

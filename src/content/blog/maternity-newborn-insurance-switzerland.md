## Introduction: Welcoming a New Arrival in Switzerland

Expecting a child is a joyous and transformative experience. For Englishâ€‘speaking residents in Switzerland, navigating pregnancy and childbirth involves understanding the local healthcare system and, crucially, the specifics of maternity and newborn insurance coverage. Switzerland boasts excellent maternal and pediatric care, but it is essential to be wellâ€‘informed about how insurance works to ensure a smooth and financially secure journey to parenthood.

This guide provides practical information on Swiss maternity and newborn insurance, including what is included in mandatory basic health insurance, the benefits of supplementary insurance, hospital choices, potential costs, and the vital steps for ensuring your newborn is covered from day one. For general information, visit our [health insurance overview](/health-insurance) page.

## Maternity Coverage Under Swiss Basic Health Insurance (Grundversicherung)

Mandatory basic health insurance in Switzerland provides comprehensive coverage for maternity care. Key aspects include:

- **No Deductible or Coâ€‘payment for Standard Maternity Services**: From the 13th week of pregnancy until eight weeks after birth, you do not pay the usual annual deductible (Franchise) or coâ€‘payment (Selbstbehalt) for standard maternity services.
- **Covered Services**: Routine checkâ€‘ups, two ultrasounds, delivery (general ward in your canton), postnatal care, breastfeeding consults, and one postnatal checkâ€‘up.

> **Quick Answer: Which costs covered?** Basic insurance covers all standard maternity services from week 13 to 8 weeks postpartum with no deductible/co-payment. Not covered: private rooms, choice of OB/clinic, extra scans, or services outside your canton.

## Supplementary Maternity Insurance (Zusatzversicherung)

Benefits can include choice of hospital/clinic, private or semiâ€‘private room, choice of obstetrician, extra prenatal tests/scans, alternative birthing options contributions, and extended postnatal care. Note typical waiting periods of 9â€“24 months.

## Choosing a Hospital or Birthing Center

Public hospitals (general ward covered by basic), private hospitals/clinics (usually require supplementary), birthing centers (covered for lowâ€‘risk; some fees), and home births (midwife services covered).

## Costs Associated with Childbirth

Basic covers most standard costs without deductible/coâ€‘payment from week 13. Additional costs can come from private/semiâ€‘private rooms, nonâ€‘covered services, or comfort addâ€‘ons.

## Insurance for Your Newborn Baby

- Preâ€‘birth registration highly recommended
- Guaranteed acceptance for basic if applied before birth or within 3 months after
- Supplementary may require health checks; easier before birth
- Coverage starts from birth when registered before birth

> **Quick Answer: When to add newborn?** Best practice: register during pregnancy for guaranteed acceptance without health checks. Latest deadline: within 3 months after birth, but pre-birth registration ensures coverage from day one and easier supplementary approval.

## Key Steps for Expectant Parents

1. Inform your insurer early
2. Review coverage (basic + supplementary)
3. Consider supplementary well in advance (waiting periods)
4. Register your baby before birth (basic + optional supplementary)
5. Discuss birthing options and plan finances

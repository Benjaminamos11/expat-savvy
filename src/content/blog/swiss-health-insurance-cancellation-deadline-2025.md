faqs:
  - question: "What is the exact Swiss health insurance cancellation deadline for 2025?"
    answer: "The Swiss health insurance cancellation deadline is 30 November 2025. Your registered cancellation letter must be received by your insurer by this date to switch providers from 1 January 2026. The postmark date is not sufficient - actual receipt matters."
  - question: "What happens if I miss the 30 November 2025 cancellation deadline?"
    answer: "If you miss the deadline, you're locked into your current provider for 2026. However, you have special termination rights within 30 days of receiving your premium increase letter (usually October). You can also switch supplementary insurance with 3 months' notice to year-end."
  - question: "Can I email or call to cancel my Swiss health insurance before the deadline?"
    answer: "No, email and phone cancellations are not legally valid. You must send a written cancellation letter by registered mail (Einschreiben/RecommandÃ©) with proof of delivery. Keep the postal receipt as evidence your insurer received the cancellation by 30 November 2025."
  - question: "Do I need to find new insurance before cancelling my current policy?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Never cancel without confirmed replacement coverage. Apply to your new provider first, receive written acceptance confirmation, then send your cancellation letter. This prevents dangerous coverage gaps that could leave you uninsured."
  - question: "What must be included in my Swiss health insurance cancellation letter?"
    answer: "Your cancellation letter must include: clear intent to cancel basic insurance, policy number, personal details (name, address, birth date), effective date (31 December 2025), and brief confirmation of replacement coverage. Send by registered mail with delivery confirmation."
  - question: "Can I use special termination rights instead of the November deadline?"
    answer: "Yes, if your premiums increase for 2026, you have special termination rights within 30 days of receiving your premium letter. This allows earlier cancellation than November 30. You must reference the premium increase in your cancellation letter and still use registered mail."

**Consequence**: Cancellation legally invalid even if received
**Solution**: Always use Einschreiben/RecommandÃ© service

### Critical Error #2: Timing Misunderstanding

**Solution**: Ensure delivery by 30 November, not just sending

### Critical Error #3: Incomplete Information

**Consequence**: Processing delays or rejected cancellation
**Solution**: Include all mandatory information elements

### Critical Error #4: Cancelling Before Securing New Coverage

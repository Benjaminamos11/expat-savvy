faqs:
  - question: "Should I choose 3rd pillar or life insurance for retirement planning?"
    answer: "For pure retirement savings, 3rd pillar is usually better due to immediate tax deductions (CHF 7,056 annually), lower fees, and investment flexibility. Choose life insurance only if you need significant death benefit protection and lack adequate coverage elsewhere. Many people use both strategically."
  - question: "Can I have both 3rd pillar and life insurance in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Yes, you can have both 3rd pillar and life insurance simultaneously. This combination often provides optimal coverage - 3rd pillar for tax-efficient retirement savings and life insurance for family protection. The strategies complement rather than compete with each other."
  - question: "Which offers better tax benefits: 3rd pillar or life insurance?"
    answer: "3rd pillar offers immediate annual tax deductions up to CHF 7,056 (employed) or CHF 35,280 (self-employed). Life insurance premiums are tax-deductible up to CHF 7,056 annually, but with different withdrawal treatment. 3rd pillar typically provides better overall tax efficiency for retirement planning."
  - question: "What are the main cost differences between 3rd pillar and life insurance?"
    answer: "3rd pillar costs 0.5-1.5% annually (bank solutions) with no insurance premiums. Life insurance costs 2-4% annually including mortality costs, administration fees, and profit margins. Over 20 years, these cost differences significantly impact net returns and wealth accumulation."
  - question: "Which is more flexible: 3rd pillar or life insurance?"
    answer: "3rd pillar offers more flexibility - easier switches between providers, no medical underwriting, simpler cancellation, and lower transfer costs. Life insurance involves medical exams, surrender penalties, complex terms, and higher switching costs. 3rd pillar allows more control over your investment."
  - question: "When does life insurance make more sense than 3rd pillar?"
    answer: "Life insurance makes sense when you need substantial death benefits (CHF 500,000+), have young children or dependents, own significant debt/mortgage, or run a business requiring key person protection. If your primary goal is retirement savings and you have adequate life coverage, 3rd pillar is usually better."

**Problem**: Thinking you must choose between 3rd pillar OR life insurance
**Reality**: Most families benefit from both, serving different purposes
**Solution**: Evaluate needs separately - retirement savings and family protection

### Mistake 2: Using Life Insurance for Investment
**Problem**: Buying whole life insurance primarily for cash value growth
**Reality**: Life insurance is expensive investment vehicle compared to 3rd pillar
**Solution**: Use 3rd pillar for investment, term life insurance for protection

**Reality**: Tax benefit limited to CHF 7,056 annually across all products
**Solution**: Buy appropriate coverage amount, maximize 3rd pillar for tax benefits

### Mistake 5: Underestimating Protection Needs
**Problem**: Focusing only on retirement savings while ignoring family protection
**Reality**: Adequate life insurance crucial for families with dependents
**Solution**: Calculate protection gap and address with appropriate coverage

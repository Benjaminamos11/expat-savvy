## Special Considerations for Expats

### For Frequent Travelers
**Basic insurance only covers emergencies abroad (limited coverage).**

Consider supplementary travel insurance if you:
- Travel frequently for work or leisure
- Visit countries with high medical costs (USA, Canada)
- Need non-emergency treatment abroad

**Best providers for international coverage:**
- Swica: Completa Top, Hospita Global
- Sanitas: Family, Classic with travel modules
- Concordia: Diversa World

### For Fitness Enthusiasts
**Get rewarded for staying active with gym reimbursements.**

**Swica leads with up to CHF 800/year for:**
- Gym memberships (Qualitop/Qualicert certified)
- Fitness classes
- Swimming pool subscriptions
- Health promotion activities

Other insurers (Sanitas, Helsana, CSS) also offer fitness benefits.

### For Families with Children
**Children pay significantly lower premiums than adults.**

**Key benefits:**
- Maternity coverage with no deductible
- Lower children's premiums
- Family discounts available
- Consider supplementary dental for orthodontics

<div style="background-color: #fef2f2; border: 2px solid #ef4444; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);">
<strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Children pay lower premiums. Maternity coverage is excellent under basic insurance. Consider supplementary dental plans for orthodontics and private room upgrades.
</div>

### For Students
**Special arrangements may apply for EU/EFTA students with EHIC cards.**

Many international students need Swiss health insurance. Some insurers offer:
- Student-specific plans
- Slightly lower premiums
- Flexible terms

### For Those with Pre-Existing Conditions
**Basic insurance must accept everyone regardless of health.**

**Important notes:**

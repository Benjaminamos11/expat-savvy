  - question: "When is the deadline to cancel Swiss health insurance for 2026?"
    answer: "You must cancel your current health insurance by 30 November 2025 to switch providers from 1 January 2026. The cancellation must be sent by registered mail and received by your insurer before this deadline."
  - question: "How do I cancel my Swiss health insurance for 2026?"
    answer: "Send a registered letter to your current insurer stating your intention to cancel basic insurance effective 31 December 2025. Include your policy number, personal details, and confirmation of new coverage. Keep proof of delivery."
  - question: "Can I switch Swiss health insurance models mid-year?"
    answer: "No, you can only change insurance models (Standard, HMO, Family Doctor, Telmed) during the annual switching period. Changes take effect from 1 January 2026 if you cancel by 30 November 2025."
  - question: "What happens if I miss the 30 November deadline for 2026?"
    answer: "If you miss the deadline, you're locked into your current provider for 2026. However, you have special termination rights within 30 days of receiving your premium increase letter, typically sent in October."
  - question: "Do I need to find new insurance before cancelling my current policy?"
    answer: "Yes, always secure new insurance first. Apply to your new provider, receive written confirmation of acceptance, then cancel your current policy. Never cancel before having confirmed new coverage."
  - question: "Can I switch supplementary insurance separately from basic insurance?"
    answer: "Yes, supplementary insurance can be cancelled anytime with 3 months' notice to end of year. However, new supplementary insurance requires medical underwriting, so apply early to avoid gaps in coverage."

## The 2026 Health Insurance Switching Process

### Step 1: Wait for 2026 Premium Letters (October 2025)

Don't make any decisions until you receive your official premium letter in early October 2025. This letter contains:

- Your 2026 premium rates compared to 2025
- Any changes to your current plan
- Information about your special termination rights
- Details about deductible and model options

**Important:** Premium increases of 5% or more trigger special termination rights, giving you 30 days from the letter date to cancel without waiting for the November deadline.

### Step 2: Research and Compare Your Options

Once you know your 2026 rates, it's time to explore alternatives:

#### Popular 2026 Models and Savings
| Model | Doctor Choice | Typical Savings vs Standard | Best For |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Standard** | Free choice | Baseline (most expensive) | Maximum flexibility |
| **Family Doctor** | Designated GP first | 10-15% savings | Consistent primary care |
| **HMO** | Network doctors only | 15-25% savings | Urban areas with good networks |
| **Telmed** | Call advice line first | 20-30% savings | Healthy, tech-comfortable users |

#### Key Providers for 2026
- **CSS**: Strong basic insurance focus, good English support
- **Helsana**: Comprehensive networks, broad supplementary options
- **SWICA**: Entry-age premiums, excellent wellness benefits
- **Sanitas**: Modern digital platform, flexible supplementary
- **Visana**: Traditional approach, strong regional presence

<p style="color: #374151; margin: 0; font-size: 0.875rem;">
Compare total costs including premiums and deductibles across models. Prioritize English support (CSS, Helsana, SWICA) if needed.

### Step 3: Apply to Your New Insurance Provider

**Critical Rule: Apply BEFORE Cancelling**

Never cancel your current insurance until you have written confirmation from your new provider. Here's the process:

1. **Submit Application**: Complete online application or paper forms
2. **Basic Insurance**: Acceptance is guaranteed - no health questions
3. **Supplementary Insurance**: Requires medical underwriting and separate application
4. **Receive Confirmation**: Get written acceptance before proceeding
5. **Verify Coverage Start**: Confirm 1 January 2026 start date

#### Application Requirements
- Personal identification (ID/passport)
- Current insurance details
- Employer information (for accident coverage coordination)
- Bank details for premium payments
- Health information (for supplementary only)

### Step 4: Cancel Your Current Insurance

Only after receiving written confirmation from your new provider:

#### Cancellation Letter Requirements
Your registered letter must include:
- **Clear intent**: "I hereby cancel my basic health insurance"
- **Effective date**: "Effective 31 December 2025"
- **Policy details**: Policy number and personal information
- **New coverage confirmation**: Brief mention of replacement coverage
- **Contact information**: Current address and phone number

#### Sample Cancellation Letter
```
[Your Name and Address]

### Step 5: Coordinate the Transition

#### Final Checklist for Smooth Transition

#### Handling Supplementary Insurance
If you're switching supplementary coverage:
- **Apply early**: Medical underwriting takes 4-8 weeks
- **Coordinate timing**: Ensure no coverage gaps
- **Document health status**: Be honest about pre-existing conditions
- **Consider waiting periods**: Some benefits have 12-24 month waiting periods

## Special Termination Rights: Your 30-Day Window

If your premium increases significantly for 2026, you have special rights:

### When Special Termination Applies
- Premium increase of any amount (even 1 CHF)
- Changes to deductible options
- Modifications to insurance models offered
- Alterations to supplementary benefits

### How to Use Special Termination
1. **Count from letter date**: 30 days from premium letter receipt
2. **Send registered mail**: Same process as regular cancellation
3. **State special termination**: Reference premium increase in letter
4. **Earlier deadline**: Can be earlier than 30 November if acted upon quickly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Cancelling Before Securing New Coverage
**Problem**: Risk of coverage gap or emergency enrollment at higher cost
**Solution**: Always apply and receive confirmation first

### 2. Missing the Registered Mail Requirement
**Problem**: Regular mail may not be accepted as valid cancellation
**Solution**: Use registered mail service and keep receipt

### 3. Incomplete Cancellation Letter
**Problem**: Unclear intent may delay processing or be rejected
**Solution**: Include all required information and clear effective date

### 4. Forgetting About Supplementary Insurance
**Problem**: Automatic renewal for another year if not cancelled separately
**Solution**: Cancel supplementary with 3 months' notice to year-end

### 5. Not Coordinating Accident Coverage
**Problem**: Double coverage or gaps in accident insurance
**Solution**: Verify employer coverage and exclude from health insurance if applicable

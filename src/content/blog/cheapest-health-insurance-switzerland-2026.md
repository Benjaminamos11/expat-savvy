## Maximum Savings Strategy: The Complete Guide

To achieve maximum savings on your 2026 health insurance, combine these strategies:

### Step 1: Choose the Cheapest Provider in Your Canton
Use [Priminfo.ch](https://priminfo.ch) when 2026 premiums are published in October 2025.

### Step 2: Select the Right Model
- **Healthy with low medical usage**: Choose Telmed (20-30% savings)
- **Want some flexibility**: Choose HMO or Family Doctor (10-20% savings)

### Step 3: Optimize Your Deductible
- **Rarely see doctors**: CHF 2,500 deductible saves CHF 100-150/month
- **Moderate medical needs**: CHF 1,000-1,500 deductible

## Quality Considerations: What You Get (and Don't Get) with Cheapest Options

### What Remains Identical
‚úÖ **Basic medical coverage**: Identical by law across all insurers  
‚úÖ **Provider network**: Access to same doctors and hospitals  
‚úÖ **Coverage scope**: Same treatments, medications, hospital stays  
‚úÖ **Legal protections**: Same patient rights and appeals processes  

### What May Differ
‚ùì **Customer service**: Phone wait times, response quality  
‚ùì **Digital tools**: App functionality, online services  
‚ùì **Language support**: Depth of English/multilingual services  
‚ùì **Claim processing**: Speed and efficiency of reimbursements  
‚ùì **Supplementary options**: Availability and pricing of add-ons  

### Making the Right Trade-offs
For most healthy expats, choosing the cheapest option makes financial sense because:
- Basic coverage is identical regardless of price
- Savings can be invested or used for direct healthcare payments
- You can always switch annually if service becomes problematic
- Emergency care quality doesn't depend on your insurer

## Special Considerations for Expats

### Language Support with Budget Insurers
While cheapest doesn't mean no English support, budget insurers typically offer:
- Basic English customer service (phone/email)
- Limited English documentation
- Fewer multilingual digital tools

**Tip**: If you need extensive support, consider paying slightly more for CSS or KPT rather than the absolute cheapest options.

### Supplementary Insurance Implications
Budget basic insurers may have:
- More limited supplementary insurance options
- Higher prices for add-ons like dental, travel, or alternative medicine
- Less flexible terms for supplementary coverage

**Strategy**: Get basic insurance from cheapest provider, supplementary from specialized provider if needed.

### Service Quality Expectations
Set appropriate expectations:
- Longer phone wait times during peak periods
- More basic digital interfaces
- Potentially slower claim processing
- Less personalized service

## Common Mistakes When Choosing Cheapest Health Insurance

### Mistake 1: Only Comparing One Element
Don't just look at insurer premiums. Compare the total cost including your optimal model and deductible combination.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Geographic Differences
Premium differences between cantons can be enormous. What's cheapest in Zurich may not be cheapest in Ticino.

### Mistake 3: Focusing Only on Current Year
Health insurance is a long-term relationship. Consider insurers' historical pattern of premium increases.

### Mistake 4: Misunderstanding Waiting Periods
Basic insurance has no waiting periods, but if you plan to add supplementary coverage, some insurers have better terms than others.

### Mistake 5: Overlooking Employment Changes
If you might become self-employed or work part-time, factor in accident coverage flexibility.

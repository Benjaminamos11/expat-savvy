faqs:
  - question: "Which is the best 3rd pillar provider in Switzerland?"
    answer: "The best provider depends on your priorities. UBS offers comprehensive investment options and digital tools. Credit Suisse provides competitive fees and fund selection. PostFinance has low costs and simplicity. Migros Bank offers sustainable investing. Insurance providers like Swiss Life provide built-in protection but higher costs."
  - question: "Should I choose a bank or insurance company for my 3rd pillar?"
    answer: "Banks typically offer better long-term returns due to lower fees (0.5-1.5% vs 2-3% for insurance) and more investment flexibility. Choose insurance only if you need additional death/disability coverage and lack adequate life insurance. For most people, bank solutions provide superior value."
  - question: "Can I have multiple 3rd pillar accounts with different providers?"
    answer: "Yes, you can open up to 5 pillar 3a accounts with different providers. This allows investment diversification, staggered withdrawals for tax optimization, and flexibility in provider selection. The total contributions across all accounts cannot exceed annual limits (CHF 7,056 for employed)."
  - question: "How do I switch my 3rd pillar provider?"
    answer: "You can transfer existing pillar 3a accounts to new providers, though some may charge transfer fees (CHF 100-300). For new contributions, simply open an account with your preferred provider. Consider keeping existing accounts if performance is good and fees are reasonable."
  - question: "What fees should I expect from 3rd pillar providers?"
    answer: "Bank solutions typically charge 0.5-1.5% annual management fees plus fund expenses (0.1-0.8%). Insurance solutions cost 2-3% annually including insurance premiums. Digital providers often offer competitive rates around 0.7-1.2%. Always compare total cost of ownership, not just headline fees."
  - question: "Which 3rd pillar provider is best for international residents?"
    answer: "UBS, Credit Suisse, and PostFinance offer excellent English support and international expertise. Digital platforms like VIAC and finpension provide modern interfaces and competitive fees. Avoid complex insurance products if you're not familiar with Swiss insurance markets."

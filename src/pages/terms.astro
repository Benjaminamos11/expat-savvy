        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: February 2026</em></p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing or using the expat-savvy.ch website, operated by Expat
            Digital Group LLC, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
            If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not access our
            services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Platform Operator vs. Broker of Record</h2>
        <p>
            Please note the distinct roles of the entities delivering our
            service:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Platform Operator:</strong> Expat Digital Group LLC (1209
                MOUNTAIN ROAD PL NE STE N, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87110 USA) is the managing
                entity responsible for website operation, content publishing, and
                lead generation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Broker of Record:</strong> All specific insurance advisory,
                consultation, and brokerage services are strictly provided by Lang
                & Partner GmbH, a FINMA-registered independent insurance broker in
                Switzerland. Expat Digital Group LLC does not provide regulated financial
                or insurance advice directly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Use of Content</h2>
        <p>
            The guides, checklists, and articles on Expat-Savvy are for
            informational purposes only. While we strive to ensure maximum
            accuracy regarding Swiss relocation and health insurance, laws and
            premiums change frequently. The content does not constitute binding
            legal or financial advice.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            Expat Digital Group LLC shall not be held liable for any direct,
            indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the
            use or inability to use the website, or for any reliance placed on
            educational content. Insurance coverage decisions ultimately reside
            exclusively between the user and their chosen insurer, mediated by
            Lang & Partner GmbH.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Modifications</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time.
            Your continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any
            updated Terms.

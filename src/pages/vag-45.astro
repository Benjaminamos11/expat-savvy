        <h2>1. Identity and Contact Details</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
            Lang & Partner GmbH acts as an independent (ungebundener) insurance
            broker. This means they are not tied to any single insurance company
            by exclusivity agreements and can objectively compare and recommend
            products across the Swiss market that best fit your specific needs
            as an expat.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Role of Expat Digital Group LLC</h2>

            Expat Digital Group LLC (NM, USA) operates the expat-savvy.ch
            website as a marketing and educational portal. Expat Digital Group
            LLC is not a regulated insurance broker in Switzerland and does not
            perform advisory functions. They merely facilitate the technical
            transmission of your request to Lang & Partner GmbH.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Liability and Complaints</h2>

            When you submit a consultation request, your data is securely
            handled in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection
            (FADP) to fulfill the advisory mandate.

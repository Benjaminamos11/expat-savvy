  {
    question: "What is the 3rd pillar and why do I need it?",
    answer: "The 3rd pillar is a voluntary private pension scheme in Switzerland that complements the mandatory 1st and 2nd pillars. It helps you save additional money for retirement while offering significant tax advantages. It's particularly important for expats who may have gaps in their Swiss pension contributions."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Pillar 3a and 3b?",
    answer: "Pillar 3a is a restricted pension plan with tax benefits and annual contribution limits (6,826 CHF for employed persons, 34,128 CHF for self-employed). Pillar 3b is unrestricted private savings with no limits but fewer tax advantages."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start a 3rd pillar account?",
    answer: "You can open a 3rd pillar account with any Swiss bank or insurance company. We recommend comparing different providers to find the best solution for your needs. Our experts can help you understand the options and set up your account."
  },
  {
    question: "When can I withdraw my 3rd pillar funds?",
    answer: "Regular withdrawal is possible 5 years before reaching AHV retirement age. Early withdrawal is allowed for: buying property, starting a business, moving abroad permanently, or switching to self-employment."
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I contribute to my 3rd pillar?",
    answer: "For employed persons, the maximum tax-deductible amount in 2025 is 7,056 CHF. For self-employed persons without a 2nd pillar, it's up to 20% of net income or maximum 35,280 CHF. Contributing the maximum amount optimizes tax benefits."

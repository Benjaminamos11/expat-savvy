    title: "3rd Pillar Insurance: The Secure Path for Expats in Switzerland",

        "Discover why a 3rd pillar insurance solution provides superior security, discipline, and a clear path to homeownership for expats in Switzerland. Compare the benefits and find your ideal plan.",

const faqs = [
    {
        question: "Do I absolutely need an insurance 3a to get a mortgage?",
        answer: "While not legally mandatory in all cases, many Swiss banks require an insurance-linked 3a policy as collateral (pledging). This ensures the mortgage can be amortized and eventually repaid even in the event of death or disability, making your application significantly stronger.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the current Technical Interest Rate for Swiss Life?",
        answer: "The 'Technischer Zins' varies by product and year of contract, but it represents a guaranteed minimum return on the savings portion of your premium. Unlike bank accounts where rates can drop to zero, this provides a reliable floor for your capital accumulation.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does the Premium Waiver work in practice?",
        answer: "If you become unable to work due to illness or accident (disability), the insurance company takes over your premium payments. Your 3a account continues to grow and your insurance protection remains in force, exactly as if you were still paying into it yourself.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I lose money with a Swiss Life Dynamic Elements policy?",
        answer: "Modern products like Dynamic Elements Duo are designed to balance stock market opportunities with capital guarantees. While the investment portion fluctuates, the integrated guarantees ensure that a part of your capital and/or a minimum pension is always protected.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I want to leave Switzerland after buying a home?",
        answer: "Your 3a insurance policy remains a valuable asset. If you leave Switzerland permanently, you may be able to withdraw the capital (subject to certain conditions and the 3-year blocking period if you used it for a mortgage). Alternatively, you can often keep the policy active to maintain your global life insurance coverage.",

                    <p>
                        Swiss banks favor insurance-based 3a solutions as
                        collateral for a simple reason: **Guarantee.** They need
                        to know that the mortgage will be repaid even if the
                        unthinkable happens. A bank 3a account offers zero
                        protection if you die or become disabled. An insurance
                        3a, however, clears the debt automatically, protecting
                        both the bank's investment and your family's home.

    {
        question: "What happens to my 3a contributions if I become disabled?",
        answer: "With an insurance-based 3a solution, you benefit from a 'Premium Waiver'. This means that if you are unable to work due to illness or accident, the insurance company takes over your contributions for you. Your retirement goal remains on track, regardless of your ability to earn an income. This is a critical protection that bank or app-based solutions do not provide.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I get life insurance with a bank 3a?",
        answer: "No. Bank-based 3a accounts (like VIAC, Finpension, or Frankly) are purely investment or savings accounts. They do not include any insurance components. If you want life insurance coverage, you would need to buy a separate policy, which is often more expensive and less tax-efficient than an integrated 3a solution.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "Is an insurance 3a really inflexible if I leave Switzerland?",
        answer: "This is a common myth. While insurance contracts are longer-term, they offer a unique 'conversion' feature (3a to 3b). This allows you to maintain your insurance protection and continue your investment compounding even after you move abroad. Bank accounts, by contrast, must usually be liquidated when you leave, potentially in a market downturn.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why not just buy separate life insurance?",
        answer: "Separate life insurance is paid for with after-tax money (Pillar 3b). By integrating it into your Pillar 3a, your premiums are tax-deductible. For a young professional, this essentially means the Swiss tax office is subsidizing roughly 20-35% of your insurance costs.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "I'm single with no kids. Do I still need the protection component?",
        answer: "The 'protection' isn't just for others—it's for you. The risk of disability is statistically much higher for young people than the risk of death. Ensuring that your retirement wealth continues to build even if you can't work is the ultimate 'self-insurance'.",
    },

                        In Switzerland, time is quite literally money. Waiting
                        just one decade to start your 3rd pillar doesn't just
                        cost you 10 years of contributions—it costs you a
                        lifetime of interest.

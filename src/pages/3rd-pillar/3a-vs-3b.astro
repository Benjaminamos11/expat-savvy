        "A detailed comparison of Pillar 3a vs. 3b for expats in Switzerland. Understand the tax differences, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules to choose the right one for you.",

const faqs = [
    {
        question: "Can I have both a Pillar 3a and a Pillar 3b?",
        answer: "Absolutely. In fact, for many high-income earners, this is the optimal strategy. You maximize your tax-deductible contributions into 3a first (CHF 7,258), and then direct any additional savings into a flexible 3b investment plan for medium-term goals.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to my 3a if I leave Switzerland?",
        answer: "If you leave Switzerland permanently (de-register), you can usually withdraw your entire Pillar 3a capital, regardless of your age. You will pay a capital withdrawal tax at that time. Note: If you move to an EU/EFTA country, you may not be able to withdraw the mandatory part of your 2nd pillar, but the 3rd pillar remains accessible.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is Pillar 3b worth it if it's not tax-deductible?",
        answer: "Yes, for specific goals. While you don't get the upfront tax break, 3b policies (especially insurance wrappers) often offer tax-free payouts or tax-deferred growth under certain conditions (e.g., if held for 10+ years and paid out after age 60 in some cantons). It also bypasses probate laws in some cases, which is powerful for estate planning.",
    },
    {
        question: "How many 3a accounts should I have?",
        answer: "We recommend having at least 5 separate 3a accounts. This allows you to stagger your withdrawals over 5 years (e.g. at ages 60, 61, 62, 63, 64), which breaks the progressive tax rate on withdrawal. This 'Ladder Strategy' can save you thousands in exit taxes.",
    },
    {
        question: "As an expat, which pillar should I prioritize?",
        answer: "Almost always Pillar 3a first. The guaranteed return from the tax saving (often ~20-30% instantly) is unmatched by any normal investment product. Only once you have filled your 3a bucket should you look at 3b or general investing.",
    },

                        Pillar 3a is the sweetheart of the Swiss pension system.
                        The government wants you to save for retirement, so they
                        offer a deal that is effectively an instant rebate on
                        your savings. Every franc you put into Pillar 3a is
                        removed from your taxable income.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="spoke-h3">Who is Pillar 3a For?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is specifically designed for <strong
                            >Employees with an AHV-liable income</strong
                        > and the <strong>Self-Employed</strong>. If you pay
                        taxes in Switzerland, the 3a is usually the single most
                        effective tool in your financial arsenal.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="spoke-h3">The "Top-Slice" Effect</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since Switzerland uses progressive tax rates, your 3rd
                        pillar deduction comes off the "top" of your income
                        stack. If your marginal tax rate is 25%, a CHF 7,000
                        contribution effectively only costs you CHF 5,250. You
                        "earn" CHF 1,750 instantly.

                        Pillar 3b is "free provision." While you lose the
                        upfront tax deduction, you gain something else entirely: <strong

                        (insurance, stocks, cash) that you dedicate to your retirement
                        without the government's strings attached.

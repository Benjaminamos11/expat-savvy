        "As a self-employed expat in Switzerland, you are your own safety net. Learn how to use the 'big 3a' to build a fortress of protection and savings.",

        question:
            "I'm healthy and have no family. Do I still need the insurance part?",
        answer: "The 'protection' isn't just for others—it's for you. As a self-employed professional, your most valuable asset is your ability to work. If a long-term illness or accident happens, the Premium Waiver in an insurance 3a ensures your retirement savings continue to grow even when your income stops. It's the ultimate 'business continuity plan' for your life.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "Are the fees of an insurance 3a worth it compared to a bank?",
        answer: "For self-employed people, yes. While bank 3a fees are lower, they provide zero insurance. Buying separate disability and life insurance usually costs more than the 'premium' part of a 3a policy, and doesn't offer the same tax efficiencies. In the 'Big 3a' space, the security of a guaranteed contribution waiver is worth far more than a 0.5% difference in management fees.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if my income fluctuates wildly year to year?",
        answer: "Modern insurance 3a plans for entrepreneurs are designed for this. You can adjust your annual contributions, use 'payment holidays' in lean years, or use a hybrid strategy: a stable insurance base for your core protection and a flexible bank 3a for surplus years.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "Can I switch back to a regular 3a if I take a full-time job later?",
        answer: "Yes. If you return to employment and join a 2nd Pillar pension fund, your 3a limit simply reverts to the 'Small 3a' limit (CHF 7,258). Your existing assets remain, and your insurance coverage continues based on the new premium level.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I prove my income to be eligible for the 'Big 3a'?",
        answer: "You typically provide your last finalized tax assessment (Einschätzungsmitteilung) or a statement of earnings from your AHV/AVS compensation office. The key is that you have no active contributions to a 2nd Pillar fund.",
    },

                For self-employed expats, the 3rd pillar isn't just a pension
                plan—it's your replacement for a corporate safety net. This

                your family, and your future.

                            fund (LPP/BVG), the Swiss government grants you a

                            (2026 limit). This represents one of the most

                            you for disability, provides a death benefit for
                            your family, and builds a retirement pot alongside
                            you.

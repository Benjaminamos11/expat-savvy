        question: "What is the deadline for making a 3a contribution?",
        answer: "The hard deadline is December 31st of the calendar year. However, we recommend completing your transfer by mid-December to ensure the funds are cleared and booked in time for the tax certificate generation.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I deduct 3b contributions?",
        answer: "Generally, no. Pillar 3b (unrestricted pension) is paid from after-tax income and is not deductible from your gross income. However, it offers other benefits like tax-free growth and flexible withdrawal.",
    },
    {
        question: "How are 3rd pillar withdrawals taxed?",
        answer: "Withdrawals are taxed at a reduced rate, separate from your other income. This is called a capital withdrawal tax. By staggerring your withdrawals (the 'Ladder Strategy'), you can keep the progression low and save thousands in exit taxes.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I have to declare my 3a assets on my tax return?",
        answer: "Yes, you should declare the existence of the account/policy, but the assets themselves are exempt from wealth tax. The interest or dividends earned within the 3a are also exempt from income and withholding tax.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can my spouse and I both have a 3a account?",
        answer: "Yes. If both spouses are earning an AHV-liable income, both can contribute up to the maximum legal limit (CHF 7,258 each in 2026) and deduct it from your joint tax return.",
    },

                        The Swiss 3rd Pillar is a voluntary pension scheme that
                        is heavily incentivized by the government. When you
                        contribute to a Pillar 3a account, the entire amount is
                        deducted from your taxable income for that year.

                        >, these deductions are taken from your "marginal" tax
                        bracket—the highest percentage you pay. For a
                        high-income earner in a city like Zurich or Geneva, this
                        can mean a CHF 7,000 contribution effectively costs only
                        CHF 5,000, with the resulting CHF 2,000 being returned
                        to you as a tax refund.

                    <p>
                        When you eventually withdraw your 3rd pillar capital
                        (usually at retirement), you pay a <strong
                            >capital withdrawal tax</strong
                        >. This tax is progressive—the larger the single
                        withdrawal, the higher the tax rate.

                    <p>
                        By opening <strong>multiple 3a accounts</strong> (we recommend
                        five) and staggering their closure over five consecutive years
                        (e.g., ages 60–64), you keep each withdrawal in a lower tax
                        bracket. This simple "Ladder Strategy" can save you between
                        20% and 40% in exit taxes.

                    <p>
                        For expats who moved to Switzerland later in their
                        careers, there is often a "pension gap" in their 2nd
                        Pillar (LPP). You are legally allowed to "buy in" to
                        your pension fund to fill this gap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These buy-ins are <strong>fully tax-deductible</strong> and
                        have much higher limits than the 3rd pillar. Combining a maxed-out
                        3rd pillar with strategic 2nd pillar buy-ins is the ultimate
                        way to reduce your Swiss tax burden to the legal minimum.

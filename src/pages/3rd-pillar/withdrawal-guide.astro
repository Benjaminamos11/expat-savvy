        question: "What is the exact process to reclaim the withholding tax?",
        answer: "When you withdraw your pension assets while living abroad, Switzerland deducts a withholding tax (Quellensteuer). To reclaim this, you typically need to prove that you are being taxed in your new country of residence and that a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) exists between Switzerland and that country. The process involves submitting specialized forms (e.g., Form 7) to the tax office of the canton where your pension foundation is located.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "How do I find out how much of my 2nd pillar is 'extra-mandatory'?",
        answer: "This information is found on your annual Pension Certificate (Vorsorgeausweis). Look for the section titled 'LPP/BVG Capital' or 'Mandatory Capital'. The difference between your total balance and this mandatory amount is your extra-mandatory capital, which is more flexible to withdraw if moving to the EU/EFTA.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I convert a bank 3a into a 3b when I leave?",
        answer: "No, bank-based 3a accounts (like those with VIAC or Finpension) are strictly cash or securities accounts. Upon leaving, these must be closed and the cash paid out. Only insurance-based 3a policies offer the 'conversion' feature where the contract continues as a 3b plan, maintaining your insurance cover and investment continuity.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "What are the tax implications of my 3b policy in my new country?",
        answer: "This varies by country. While Switzerland may treat 3b payouts as tax-free under certain conditions, your new country might view the growth as taxable capital gains or the conversion as a taxable event. We strongly recommend a consultation to review the specific treaty between Switzerland and your destination.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does this affect my AHV (1st Pillar) benefits?",
        answer: "Leaving Switzerland does not 'cancel' your 1st pillar. You stop contributing to the Swiss system, but your past contributions remain. Depending on your nationality and the years contributed, you may be eligible for a partial Swiss pension at retirement age, or in some cases (for non-EU/EFTA nationals moving to non-agreement countries), a refund of your contributions.",

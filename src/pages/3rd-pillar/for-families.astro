        "Learn how to use the 3rd pillar to protect your family's future in Switzerland. A complete guide to life insurance, disability protection, and long-term savings for expat parents.",

    {
        question:
            "We already have death & disability coverage from our jobs (2nd Pillar). Isn't that enough?",
        answer: "For many expat families, no. The 2nd Pillar (LPP) typically covers only 60% of your current salary in the event of disability or death. If you have a high cost of living, a mortgage, or children in private schools, this 40% gap can be catastrophic. An insurance 3a is designed to close this specific gap tax-efficiently.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "Can we use the 3a money to pay for our children's university education?",
        answer: "While the primary purpose is retirement or homeownership, building a substantial 3a pot gives you flexibility. If you withdraw the funds at retirement (or earlier for homeownership), that capital can certainly support your children's higher education costs. It's about building a versatile family pool of wealth.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to the policy if we have another child?",
        answer: "The great thing about 3a insurance is that you can adjust the death benefit or the coverage levels as your family grows. You don't necessarily need a new policy; we can often perform a 'policy adjustment' to ensure your new family member is fully protected.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "Is it better to have one big policy or two smaller ones for a couple?",
        answer: "We almost always recommend two separate policies (The Cross-Life Strategy). This ensures that both partners are independently insured and building their own tax-deductible savings pots. It doubles the protection and provides two separate buffers against life's risks.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "How much life insurance does a typical family in Switzerland need?",
        answer: "A good rule of thumb is 5x to 10x your annual salary, plus the value of your mortgage. However, every family is different. We look at your specific expenses, debts, and your partner's earning potential to find the 'safety number' that lets you sleep at night.",

                For expat parents in Switzerland, the 3rd pillar is more than a
                pension—it's a fortress for your family. This guide explains how
                to build a plan that protects against life's biggest risks.

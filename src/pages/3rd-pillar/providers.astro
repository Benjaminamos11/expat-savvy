        question:
            "Are the returns on insurance products really as good as digital apps?",
        answer: "Yes. Modern insurance solutions like Swiss Life Dynamic Elements Duo utilize equity-focused strategies that compete directly with digital-only portfolios. The key difference is the added layer of capital guarantees and integrated protection that apps lack.",
    },
    {
        question: "If I use VIAC, can't I just buy separate life insurance?",
        answer: "You can, but it is often less efficient. Combining a bank 3a with standalone insurance usually results in higher total costs and more administrative complexity. More importantly, bank 3a accounts are not as favored by Swiss banks as mortgage collateral compared to insurance policies.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "What are the exact costs of a Swiss Life Dynamic Elements Duo policy?",
        answer: "Costs depend on your age, contribution level, and chosen protection. However, the 'all-in' cost—including management and the safety net—is strategically positioned to provide better long-term value than a fragmented DIY strategy.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why are traditional banks no longer a good option?",
        answer: "Traditional banks often combine higher fees with lower investment flexibility and zero integrated insurance. In the 2026 landscape, they represent an outdated middle ground that offers neither the low cost of apps nor the high security of modern insurance.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I know which of the 'Three Paths' is right for me?",
        answer: "It depends on your goals: if you only care about the lowest fee today, apps win. If you care about homeownership, family security, and guaranteed retirement capital, the modern insurance path is the intelligent choice.",

                                side of the Swiss 3rd pillar. By slashing
                                management fees and allowing users to open an
                                account in minutes, they are the 'entry ticket'

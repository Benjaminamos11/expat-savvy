  {
    question: "What is legal protection insurance and why do I need it in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Legal protection insurance covers legal costs including lawyer fees, court costs, and expert opinions. In Switzerland, where legal proceedings can be expensive, it provides financial security and access to legal expertise for various situations like rental disputes, employment issues, or traffic accidents."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does legal protection insurance cost in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Annual premiums typically range from 200-500 CHF, depending on the coverage type and provider. Combined packages (private + traffic) often offer better value. Some insurers offer discounts when bundled with other insurance products."
  },
  {
    question: "What does legal protection insurance typically cover?",
    answer: "Coverage typically includes private legal matters (contracts, consumer rights), traffic-related issues, rental disputes, employment law, and internet legal protection. Most policies cover lawyer fees, court costs, expert opinions, and provide access to legal advice hotlines."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any waiting periods?",
    answer: "Yes, most policies have a waiting period of 3-6 months for new cases. However, coverage for accidents and criminal defense usually starts immediately. The waiting period helps prevent people from taking out insurance only when they already have a legal issue."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose my own lawyer?",
    answer: "This depends on the policy. Some insurers allow free choice of lawyer, while others work with a network of preferred legal partners. In court proceedings, you usually have the right to choose your lawyer, but for other matters, the insurer may assign one."

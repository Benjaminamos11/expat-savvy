const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What insurance is mandatory in Zurich for expats?",
    answer: "Health insurance (KVG/LAMal) is mandatory for all residents in Zurich and throughout Switzerland. You must obtain coverage within three months of arrival, and it's retroactive to your arrival date. For employed individuals, accident insurance is typically provided by your employer. If you own a car, motor vehicle insurance is also mandatory."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does health insurance cost in Zurich for a foreigner?",
    answer: "Health insurance premiums in Zurich typically range from CHF 300-500 per month for adults, depending on the model and deductible chosen. Zurich has higher average premiums compared to other cantons due to its extensive healthcare infrastructure. Choosing a higher deductible (up to CHF 2,500) or restricted model (HMO, Family Doctor, Telmed) can lower your monthly premium."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my existing health insurance in Zurich?",
    answer: "If you're from an EU/EFTA country, you may be able to keep your existing health insurance temporarily under certain conditions, but you'll need to apply for exemption. For most expats, especially those from non-EU countries, you'll need to take out Swiss health insurance within three months of arrival. International health insurance plans generally don't satisfy the legal requirement for basic coverage in Switzerland."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best area to live in Zurich for expats?",
    answer: "Popular expat areas include Kreis 2 (family-friendly), Kreis 6 (near universities), and Kreis 7 (upscale). Each district offers different advantages - Kreis 2 has excellent schools and lake access, Kreis 6 offers a vibrant atmosphere, while Kreis 7 provides prestigious addresses with great views. Your choice should depend on your lifestyle, budget, and proximity to work or schools."
  },
  {
    question: "Is English widely spoken in Zurich?",
    answer: "Yes, English is widely spoken in Zurich, especially in business and tourism. Many services, including healthcare and government offices, offer English support. However, learning basic German is recommended for better integration and daily interactions, as not all service providers may speak fluent English, especially outside central areas."

            Accident insurance in Switzerland is divided into two components:

            <li><strong>Occupational Accident Insurance (BU):</strong> Covers accidents that occur during work hours</li>

            If you work at least 8 hours per week for the same employer in Zurich, your employer must provide both occupational and non-occupational accident insurance. If you work fewer hours or are self-employed, you need to ensure accident coverage through your health insurance.

        <div class="prose prose-lg mb-8">
          <p>
            Household contents insurance (Hausratversicherung) protects your personal belongings against risks like theft, fire, and water damage. In Zurich's expensive housing market, furnishing a home represents a significant investment that deserves protection.

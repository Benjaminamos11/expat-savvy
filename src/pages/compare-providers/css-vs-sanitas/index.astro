        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternative Medicine:</strong> Sanitas often stands out for its more extensive coverage and focus on alternative medicine within its supplementary plans like Classic and Family. CSS also offers good alternative medicine benefits through its myCSS supplementary insurance options.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>International Private Hospital Insurance:</strong> Both insurers provide options for international private hospital coverage, essential for expats who travel frequently or may seek treatment abroad. CSS has its myCSS Hospital Insurance suite, while Sanitas offers plans like Hospital Extra Liberty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gym & Health Promotion:</strong> CSS offers a Health Account within its supplementary plans, which can contribute up to CHF 500 towards gym memberships and other health activities. Sanitas encourages healthy living through various contributions and its Sanitas Active App, which can offer rewards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dental:</strong> Both provide dedicated dental insurance plans, which are vital as dental care is largely uncovered by basic Swiss insurance.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Do They Handle Pre-existing Conditions?</h3>
        <p>
          For mandatory basic insurance, acceptance is guaranteed by both CSS and Sanitas. For supplementary plans, both will use a health questionnaire. This can result in waiting periods, premium adjustments, or exclusions. A unique aspect of Sanitas is their occasional offer of an "Individual Premium Supplement" for certain pre-existing conditions on some supplementary plans, allowing coverage at an additional cost where other insurers might decline.
        </p>

        <h3>Which Provider Offers Better Expat-Friendly Features?</h3>
        <p>
          Sanitas often receives high marks for its digital experience, with a highly-rated and comprehensive Sanitas Portal app. They also provide very good English language support and documentation. CSS also boasts a strong digital platform with its myCSS app and portal, and offers good English support, making it a solid choice for expats.
        </p>

        <h3>How Do Their Customer Service and Claims Processing Compare?</h3>
        <p>
          Both CSS and Sanitas generally receive good customer satisfaction ratings. Sanitas often edges slightly ahead in overall satisfaction and is particularly praised for its efficient digital claims processing. CSS also provides reliable and efficient claims handling, especially through its digital channels.

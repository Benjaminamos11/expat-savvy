        <h2>Detailed Breakdown: Swica vs. Sanitas</h2>
        <p>Let's dive into the specifics, particularly concerning their digital offerings and expat services:</p>

        <h3>Basic Insurance & Premiums</h3>
        <p>
          Both Swica and Sanitas offer the standard suite of basic insurance models, allowing expats to choose based on their preferences for cost and access to care. Premium-wise, both are in the moderate to upper-moderate range, reflecting their quality of service and comprehensive offerings. Swica is often perceived as slightly more premium in its pricing but justifies this with exceptional service.
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Experience: mySwica vs. Sanitas Portal</h3>
        <p>This is a key area where both insurers excel, making them attractive for tech-savvy expats.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Swica (mySwica app & portal):</strong> Swica's digital platform is consistently praised for its intuitive design, ease of use, and comprehensive features. Expats can easily submit claims by photo, view policy documents, manage personal details, find doctors, and access telemedicine services. The English version is well-maintained.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sanitas (Sanitas Portal app & online portal):</strong> Sanitas also boasts an excellent digital offering. The Sanitas Portal app is highly rated for its functionality, allowing users to manage all aspects of their insurance, submit invoices, access digital health coaching, and utilize services like medication ordering or symptom checkers. Their English digital services are also very comprehensive.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>While both are top-tier, some users might find the mySwica interface slightly more streamlined, whereas the Sanitas Portal might offer a broader range of integrated digital health services.</p>

        <h3>Expat-Friendliness: Language, Support, and Onboarding</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>English Language Support:</strong> Both Swica and Sanitas provide very good English language support. Swica has a dedicated English-speaking customer service line, and their website and documents are widely available in English. Sanitas also offers extensive English documentation and reliable English-speaking customer service agents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Onboarding for New Arrivals:</strong> Both insurers have experience catering to expatriates and provide resources and information to help new arrivals understand the Swiss health system and get their insurance set up. Swica's proactive customer service is often highlighted by expats as particularly helpful during the initial phase.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Coverage Tailored for Expats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>International Coverage:</strong> Swica's HOSPITA GLOBAL PRIVATE is a standout option for comprehensive worldwide private hospital coverage. Sanitas also offers strong international hospital plans like Hospital Extra Liberty and Hospital Top Liberty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternative Medicine & Wellness:</strong> Sanitas is well-regarded for its extensive supplementary coverage for alternative medicine. Swica also provides good options, especially with its Completa Top and Optima plans, the latter also offering significant contributions (up to CHF 800/year) to gym memberships and wellness activities. Sanitas encourages wellness through its Active App and various plan contributions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Handling of Pre-existing Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          For supplementary insurance, both require a health declaration. Swica is known for a thorough assessment. Sanitas also assesses health status but uniquely offers, in some cases, an "Individual Premium Supplement" for certain pre-existing conditions on some supplementary plans, which can be a valuable option for expats who might otherwise face exclusions.

        <h2>Detailed Breakdown: Swica vs. Helsana</h2>
        <p>Let's delve deeper into how Swica and Helsana compare on specific points:</p>

        <h3>Basic Insurance & Premiums</h3>
        <p>
          Both Swica and Helsana offer the standard range of basic insurance models (Standard, Telmed, HMO, GP). Premiums are generally in the moderate to high range for both, reflecting their comprehensive service and network quality. Your specific premium will depend heavily on your canton, age, and chosen deductible. Swica is often lauded for its customer service within these models, while Helsana provides a robust network of doctors and HMOs.
        </p>

        <h3>Supplementary Showdown: Coverage Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>International Private Hospital Insurance:</strong> Both providers offer excellent supplementary plans for worldwide private hospital coverage. Swica's HOSPITA GLOBAL PRIVATE and Helsana's HOSPITAL GLOBAL are top-tier options for expats requiring global flexibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check-ups & Prevention:</strong> Swica, particularly with its Optima plan, places a strong emphasis on preventative care and check-ups, offering substantial contributions. Helsana also provides good coverage for preventative measures through various supplementary plans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gym & Health Promotion:</strong> Swica is well-known for its generous contributions to gym memberships and health promotion activities (up to CHF 800/year with Optima). Helsana also offers attractive contributions, often through a combination of basic and supplementary plans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dental:</strong> Both offer dedicated dental insurance plans (Swica Denta, Helsana Dental/Denta Plus), which are crucial as dental care is not covered by basic insurance in Switzerland.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pre-existing Conditions: What Expats Need to Know</h3>
        <p>
          For mandatory basic insurance, both Swica and Helsana must accept all applicants regardless of pre-existing conditions. However, for supplementary insurance, both will require a health questionnaire. Depending on your health status, this could lead to waiting periods, premium loadings, or exclusions for specific conditions. It's vital to be transparent during this process.
        </p>

        <h3>Expat Experience: Language, Support & Digital Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Swica generally has a slight edge in overall expat-friendliness, with a dedicated English support line and consistently high praise for its English services. Their mySwica app is also highly rated for its ease of use. Helsana also offers good English support, English documentation, and a user-friendly app (Helsana+), making them a strong contender for expats.
        </p>

        <h3>Customer Voice & Claims</h3>
        <p>
          Swica consistently receives top marks in customer satisfaction surveys (e.g., from Comparis and K-Tipp). Helsana also scores well, though typically slightly behind Swica in overall satisfaction. Both providers offer efficient claims processing, especially through their digital platforms.

    question: "Is SWICA better than Helsana for expats in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Both are excellent for expats. SWICA excels in English customer service and satisfaction ratings (5.4/6 vs Helsana's 5.2/6). Helsana offers broader provider networks and more supplementary options. Choose SWICA for service-first experience, Helsana for network breadth. Premium differences are typically minimal."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is cheaper: SWICA or Helsana health insurance?",
    answer: "Premiums are similar for both providers, varying by canton, age, model, and deductible. Neither is consistently cheaper. SWICA might be slightly higher in some cantons, Helsana in others. Focus on service quality and supplementary benefits rather than basic premium differences."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch from Helsana to SWICA for 2026?",
    answer: "Yes, cancel your current Helsana policy by 30 November 2025 to switch to SWICA from 1 January 2026. Basic insurance switching is guaranteed. Supplementary insurance requires separate applications and may involve medical underwriting. Plan early for smooth transition."
  },
  {
    question: "Do SWICA and Helsana offer English customer service?",

  },
  {
    question: "What are the main differences between SWICA and Helsana supplementary insurance?",
    answer: "SWICA offers generous wellness contributions (up to CHF 1,300/year with Completa Forte) and strong prevention focus through Optima plans.

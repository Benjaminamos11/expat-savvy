        <h2>Detailed Breakdown: Swica vs. CSS (Premium & Active Focus)</h2>
        <p>Let's explore the nuances of how these two insurers stack up, with a special focus on their premium offerings and support for active lifestyles:</p>

        <h3>Premium Offerings & Service Quality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Swica:</strong> Often regarded as a premium provider, Swica is known for its excellent customer service, particularly its proactive and helpful English support for expats. While their premiums can be higher, many feel it's justified by the service quality, comprehensive benefits (especially with plans like Optima), and high customer satisfaction ratings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS:</strong> As one of the largest insurers, CSS offers a reliable and comprehensive service. Their customer service is generally good, and they provide solid support for expats. While not always positioned as overtly premium as Swica, their offerings are robust and cater well to those seeking quality and a wide range of options.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits for an Active Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>
          This is an area where both insurers offer attractive benefits, appealing to expats who prioritize health and fitness:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Swica:</strong> Stands out with its Optima supplementary plan, which can contribute up to CHF 800 per year towards gym memberships, fitness classes, and other health promotion activities. For those seeking even more coverage, the Completa Forte plan offers up to CHF 1300 per year for fitness activities. They also have good coverage for sports-related medical needs and preventative health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS:</strong> Features the myCSS Health Account, which allows policyholders to receive contributions (often up to CHF 500 per year, depending on the plan combination) for a variety of health and fitness expenses, including gym memberships, swimming pool entries, and more. This provides flexibility in how the wellness budget is used.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While Swica's potential direct contribution for fitness is higher with Optima, CSS's Health Account offers a flexible way to get reimbursed for various wellness activities.
        </p>

        <h3>Supplementary Coverage for Comprehensive Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>International Private Hospital:</strong> Swica's HOSPITA GLOBAL PRIVATE is a top-tier option for worldwide private hospital coverage. CSS also offers good international hospital plans through its myCSS suite, suitable for expats who travel or may seek care abroad.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternative Medicine & Prevention:</strong> Both provide good coverage. Swica's Completa Top and Optima plans are strong in these areas. CSS offers similar benefits through its various myCSS supplementary options, including contributions to preventative check-ups via the Health Account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Digital Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Both Swica (mySwica app) and CSS (myCSS app) offer excellent, user-friendly digital platforms for managing policies, submitting claims, and accessing services. This is a significant plus for expats accustomed to digital convenience.

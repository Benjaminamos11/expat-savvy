// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Which alternative therapies are covered by basic Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "Since 2017, basic health insurance (KVG/LAMal) in Switzerland covers five complementary therapies when performed by certified medical doctors: acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), anthroposophic medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, and herbal medicine (phytotherapy). Other therapies like osteopathy, naturopathy, and kinesiology are typically not covered by basic insurance but may be included in supplementary insurance packages."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between getting alternative treatments from a doctor versus a non-medical therapist?",
    answer: "When alternative treatments are administered by doctors with recognized additional qualifications in these disciplines, they are typically covered by basic insurance. However, the same treatments from non-medical practitioners (therapists without medical degrees) are only covered if you have appropriate supplementary insurance. The extent of coverage, waiting periods, and annual limits for non-medical practitioners vary significantly between insurance providers and supplementary packages."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my alternative medicine practitioner is recognized by insurance companies?",
    answer: "For insurance recognition, therapists should be registered with official Swiss bodies like ASCA (Swiss Foundation for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) or RME (Register of Empirical Medicine). Before booking appointments, you can verify a therapist's registration status by checking these organizations' websites or asking the practitioner directly for their registration numbers. Additionally, confirm with your insurance provider that they accept the specific registrations your therapist holds."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there limits to how much alternative therapy is covered by insurance?",
    answer: "Yes, most insurers impose annual limits on alternative therapy coverage. Basic insurance follows the general rules of franchise (deductible) and co-pay but doesn't have specific limits for recognized therapies performed by doctors. Supplementary insurance typically sets annual maximums either as a monetary amount (e.g., CHF 1,000 per year) or as a number of sessions (e.g., 12 treatments annually). Some policies also specify maximum rates per session or require minimum qualifications for practitioners."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add supplementary insurance for alternative medicine if I already have a health condition?",
    answer: "Unlike basic health insurance, supplementary insurance providers can reject applications based on pre-existing conditions or impose waiting periods before coverage begins for certain treatments. If you already have health issues you want to treat with alternative medicine, you might face restrictions or exclusions when applying for new supplementary coverage. It's best to explore options before developing conditions requiring treatment. Existing supplementary insurance will generally continue to cover new conditions that develop after the policy starts."

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Switzerland stands out globally for its progressive approach to complementary and alternative medicine. In 2009, Swiss citizens voted to include certain alternative therapies in the nation's constitution, leading to their integration into the basic health insurance system by 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
          This unique recognition reflects Switzerland's holistic approach to healthcare, where conventional and alternative treatments often work in harmony. However, navigating the specifics of coverage can be complex, especially for expats unfamiliar with the Swiss system.

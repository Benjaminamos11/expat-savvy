// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much do relocation agencies cost in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Relocation agency costs in Switzerland typically range from CHF 3,000-15,000+ depending on services. Basic packages (apartment finding only) start around CHF 3,000-5,000. Comprehensive packages including visa support, school search, and full settling-in services can cost CHF 8,000-15,000+ for families. Always request detailed quotes and compare value, not just price."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use a large international or local Swiss relocation agency?",
    answer: "Both have advantages. International agencies offer global networks and standardized processes, beneficial for corporate moves. Local Swiss agencies like Prime Relocation provide personalized service and deep cantonal knowledge. Choose based on your needs: international for corporate relocations, local for individualized support and specific regional expertise."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I compare relocation agencies in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Use ReloFinder.ch, Switzerland's leading platform to compare relocation service providers. Evaluate agencies based on: canton-specific expertise, service scope, client testimonials, pricing transparency, communication quality, and insurance guidance. Always check references from clients with similar profiles and relocation needs."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I contact a relocation agency before moving to Switzerland?",
    answer: "Contact relocation agencies 2-3 months before your planned move, especially for competitive housing markets like Zurich or Geneva. Early contact allows time for apartment searches, school applications, and visa procedures. For corporate relocations, 3-6 months lead time is recommended for optimal results."
  },
  {
    question: "Can relocation agencies help with Swiss health insurance setup?",
    answer: "Some relocation agencies provide basic insurance guidance, but most partner with specialized insurance advisors. Ensure your chosen agency either offers comprehensive insurance support or partners with experts like Expat Savvy for mandatory health insurance setup and optimization."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the biggest mistakes when choosing a relocation agency?",
    answer: "Common mistakes include: choosing based solely on price (missing comprehensive support), not verifying canton-specific expertise, insufficient communication about expectations, ignoring client reviews, and selecting agencies without insurance guidance. Use comparison platforms like ReloFinder.ch to avoid these pitfalls."

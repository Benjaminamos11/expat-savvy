  {
    question: "What is a deductible (franchise) in Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "A deductible (franchise in French/German) is the amount you pay out-of-pocket each year for healthcare services before your insurance begins to cover costs. In Switzerland, basic health insurance offers deductible options ranging from CHF 300 to CHF 2,500. The higher your deductible, the lower your monthly premiums, but the more you'll pay before insurance coverage kicks in."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save with a higher deductible?",
    answer: "The premium reduction depends on the deductible level chosen. Generally, each step up in deductible level reduces your monthly premium. For example, increasing from the standard CHF 300 deductible to the maximum CHF 2,500 deductible can save approximately 30-40% on monthly premiums, resulting in annual savings of CHF 1,000-1,500 for an average adult, though this varies by insurer and canton."
  },
  {
    question: "When can I change my deductible?",
    answer: "You can change your deductible for the following calendar year by notifying your insurance provider by November 30. Some insurers may allow you to increase your deductible mid-year, but decreasing it is only possible at the beginning of a new calendar year."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a high deductible always better if I'm healthy?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. While healthy individuals often benefit from higher deductibles, you should consider your financial reserves, risk tolerance, and potential for unexpected health issues. Remember that a CHF 2,500 deductible means you might need to pay this amount in full before receiving insurance benefits. Unexpected health issues can happen even to healthy people."
  },
  {
    question: "Do deductibles apply to all healthcare services?",
    answer: "Most medical services are subject to the deductible, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications. However, some preventive services are exempt, such as mammograms for breast cancer screening, certain prenatal care services, and some vaccinations. Additionally, maternity-related services are not subject to the deductible once pregnancy is confirmed."

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          In Switzerland, the deductible (franchise) is a key component of the health insurance system that directly impacts both your monthly premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. It's the amount you must pay for healthcare services each year before your insurance begins to cover costs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Choosing the right deductible requires balancing immediate monthly savings against potential healthcare costs. While a higher deductible means lower monthly premiums, it also means you'll pay more out-of-pocket if you need medical care.

            For example, if increasing your deductible from CHF 300 to CHF 2,500 saves you CHF 1,000 in annual premiums, your calculation would be: CHF 1,000 + CHF 300 = CHF 1,300, which is less than CHF 2,500. In this case, you would need to have healthcare costs below CHF 1,300 to benefit from the higher deductible.

// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Which health insurance provider is cheapest in Zurich?",
    answer: "The cheapest health insurance provider in Zurich varies each year as premiums change. Currently, insurers like Assura, KPT, and Sanitas often offer competitive rates in Zurich, but prices depend on your model, deductible, and personal factors. Since Zurich has among the highest premiums in Switzerland, comparing multiple providers using tools like Priminfo.ch is essential to find the best rates."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does health insurance cost in Zurich?",
    answer: "Adult health insurance premiums in Zurich average between CHF 400-600 per month for basic coverage with a standard model and CHF 300 deductible. Choosing an alternative model (HMO, Family Doctor, Telmed) and higher deductible can reduce premiums by 20-30%. Zurich has some of Switzerland's highest premiums due to the city's extensive healthcare infrastructure and higher medical costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Zurich offer health insurance subsidies?",
    answer: "Yes, Zurich canton offers Prämienverbilligung (premium subsidies) for residents with lower incomes. For 2025, single adults may qualify with annual incomes below approximately CHF 50,000, while families have higher thresholds. Applications must be submitted to the SVA Zürich, and the subsidy amount depends on your income, personal situation, and current premium costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there special health insurance options for expats in Zurich?",
    answer: "While all residents access the same basic insurance system, several insurers offer services particularly valuable for Zurich's large expat community, including Swica, Sanitas, and CSS. These providers offer comprehensive English services, international coverage extensions, digital tools in multiple languages, and sometimes dedicated expat support teams who understand the challenges of navigating healthcare in a new country."
  },
  {
    question: "When can I switch health insurance in Zurich?",
    answer: "You can switch basic health insurance providers by November 30th for coverage starting January 1st (when new premiums take effect). For supplementary insurance, you must observe your current policy's notice period, typically 3-6 months. New residents to Zurich must obtain insurance within 3 months of arrival. If your premium increases, you may receive a special termination right allowing changes outside standard periods."

  },

// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right health insurance company in Switzerland?",
    answer: "To choose the right Swiss health insurance company, start by assessing your healthcare needs, budget, and priorities. Compare premium costs in your canton, evaluate service quality and language support, consider the insurance models offered (Standard, HMO, Family Doctor, Telmed), and review digital tools and supplementary options. Companies like Swica, CSS, Helsana, Sanitas, and Concordia each have different strengths, so the best choice depends on which factors matter most to you."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I find the cheapest health insurance in Switzerland?",
    answer: "To find the most affordable health insurance, compare premiums across multiple providers for your chosen model and deductible using tools like Priminfo.ch or Comparis.ch. Consider choosing alternative models (HMO, Family Doctor, Telmed) which offer 15-20% discounts, selecting a higher deductible if you rarely need medical care, and checking if you qualify for premium subsidies (Prämienverbilligung) from your canton."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth paying more for certain health insurance providers?",
    answer: "Sometimes yes. While basic insurance benefits are identical across all providers by law, service quality can differ significantly. Paying slightly more might be worthwhile for better customer service, faster claim processing, comprehensive English support, user-friendly digital tools, or excellent supplementary insurance options. Assess whether these benefits justify any premium difference for your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "What should expats look for in Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "Expats should prioritize insurers with strong English-language services, helpful support for navigating the Swiss healthcare system, digital tools accessible in English, global coverage options for travel home, and flexibility that accommodates international lifestyles. Some insurers specialize in serving the expat community and offer dedicated support for international residents."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I review my health insurance options?",
    answer: "You should review your health insurance at least annually, ideally in September-October when new premiums for the following year are announced. Additionally, reconsider your coverage after significant life changes such as moving cantons, family additions, major health developments, or changes in financial situation. Regular reviews ensure your coverage remains optimized for your current needs and budget."

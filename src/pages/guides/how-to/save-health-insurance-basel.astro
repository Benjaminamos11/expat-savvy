// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How can I qualify for health insurance subsidies in Basel?",
    answer: "To qualify for premium subsidies (Prämienverbilligung) in Basel, your annual income must fall below certain thresholds. For 2025, a single person may qualify with taxable income below approximately CHF 32,000, while a family of four may qualify with income up to CHF 48,000. Basel-Stadt automatically evaluates eligibility based on your tax declaration, but you can also apply directly if your financial situation has changed significantly."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save by changing health insurance in Basel?",
    answer: "Premium differences between the most expensive and cheapest health insurers in Basel can exceed CHF 1,500 annually for identical basic coverage. Combining a provider change with an adjustment to your insurance model (e.g., switching to HMO) and optimizing your deductible can save a typical Basel resident between CHF 800-2,500 per year. Families can potentially save even more by optimizing each family member's coverage separately."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I apply for a higher deductible in Basel?",
    answer: "If your healthcare costs will likely be lower than the difference between your current premium and the premium with a higher deductible, increasing your deductible makes financial sense. For example, if moving from a 300 CHF to 2,500 CHF deductible saves you 1,500 CHF annually in premiums, you'll benefit if your yearly medical expenses are less than 1,500 CHF. Given Basel's higher-than-average healthcare costs, this calculation is particularly important."
  },
  {
    question: "What are my options as a cross-border worker in Basel?",
    answer: "As a cross-border worker (Grenzgänger) commuting from Germany or France to Basel, you have the right to choose between Swiss health insurance or coverage in your country of residence. Many cross-border workers find significant savings by opting for German or French insurance while maintaining access to healthcare on both sides of the border. This option must be exercised within three months of starting work in Switzerland."
  },
  {
    question: "Can employees of pharmaceutical companies in Basel get special health insurance arrangements?",
    answer: "While employees of Basel's numerous pharmaceutical companies don't typically have automatic exemptions like international organization employees in Geneva, many companies offer corporate group insurance plans that provide better rates or enhanced coverage. Check with your employer's HR department to see if your company has negotiated special arrangements with specific insurers."

If you work in Basel but live in Germany or France, you have a choice regarding health insurance under bilateral agreements. Many cross-border workers find significant savings with German or French insurance while maintaining access to Basel's healthcare facilities through special arrangements.</p>

While their employees don't have automatic exemptions from the Swiss system, many benefit from corporate insurance plans with negotiated group rates or enhanced coverage options. Check with your employer's HR department to see if your company offers special insurance arrangements.</p>

The monthly premium for dedicated student insurance plans can be significantly lower than standard plans, sometimes by 40-50%.</p>

For cross-border families with members living in different countries, this can be particularly beneficial, as each family member might have different optimal insurance arrangements based on their country of residence and healthcare needs.</p>

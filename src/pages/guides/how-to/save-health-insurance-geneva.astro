// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How can I qualify for health insurance subsidies in Geneva?",
    answer: "To qualify for premium subsidies (réduction des primes) in Geneva, your annual income must fall below certain thresholds. For 2025, a single person may qualify with taxable income below approximately CHF 53,000, while a family of four may qualify with income up to CHF 100,000. The Service de l'assurance-maladie (SAM) automatically evaluates eligibility based on your tax declaration, but you can also apply directly if your financial situation has changed significantly."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save by changing health insurance in Geneva?",
    answer: "Premium differences between the most expensive and cheapest health insurers in Geneva can exceed CHF 2,000 annually for identical basic coverage. Combining a provider change with an adjustment to your insurance model (e.g., switching to HMO) and optimizing your deductible can save a typical Geneva resident between CHF 1,000-3,000 per year. Families can potentially save even more by optimizing each family member's coverage separately."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I apply for a higher deductible in Geneva?",
    answer: "If your healthcare costs will likely be lower than the difference between your current premium and the premium with a higher deductible, increasing your deductible makes financial sense. For example, if moving from a 300 CHF to 2,500 CHF deductible saves you 1,800 CHF annually in premiums, you'll benefit if your yearly medical expenses are less than 1,800 CHF. Given Geneva's high overall healthcare costs, this calculation is particularly important."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth having cross-border insurance if I work in Geneva but live in France?",
    answer: "Yes, for cross-border workers (frontaliers) who commute between Geneva and France, cross-border insurance can be significantly more affordable than standard Swiss insurance. Under bilateral agreements, you can choose to be insured either in Switzerland or France. For many frontaliers, the French system (CMU) offers considerable savings compared to Swiss premiums, while still providing access to Geneva's healthcare system with proper documentation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can international organization employees in Geneva opt out of Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "Yes, employees of international organizations based in Geneva (UN, WHO, ILO, etc.) often have access to special health insurance plans through their employers. These can be recognized as equivalent to Swiss mandatory insurance, allowing for exemption from the Swiss system. To obtain this exemption, you must submit your organization's insurance certificate to the Service de l'assurance-maladie (SAM) within three months of arriving in Geneva."

          <p class="text-gray-600">If you work in Geneva but live in neighboring France, you have a unique choice regarding health insurance. Under the bilateral agreements, you can choose either the Swiss or French healthcare system. Many frontaliers find significant savings by opting for the French CMU system while maintaining access to both French and Geneva healthcare providers.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600">Geneva hosts numerous international organizations (UN, WHO, ILO, etc.) whose employees often have access to special insurance plans. These plans can be recognized as equivalent to the Swiss mandatory insurance, allowing exemption from the Swiss system. This exemption must be requested from the Service de l'assurance-maladie (SAM) within three months of arrival.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600">International students studying in Geneva may qualify for special insurance arrangements or exemptions if they have coverage from their home country that meets Swiss standards. The monthly premium for dedicated student insurance plans can be significantly lower than standard plans, sometimes by 40-50%.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600">Families in Geneva can optimize their insurance by having different family members with different insurers, models, or deductibles based on their health needs. For example, children (who have lower premiums and no deductible) might be with a different insurer than parents, or a healthy spouse might choose a high-deductible plan while another chooses lower deductible coverage.</p>

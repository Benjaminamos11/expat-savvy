// Define frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How does Swiss health insurance work for foreigners relocating to Switzerland?",
    answer: "Swiss health insurance works identically for foreigners and Swiss citizens. Basic insurance (KVG/LAMal) is mandatory within 3 months of arrival regardless of nationality. All residents get guaranteed acceptance with identical coverage. Choose models (Standard/HMO/Telmed) based on preferences vs cost savings. Comprehensive newcomer guide at /healthcare/best-health-insurance-switzerland/."
  },
  {
    question: "Do students in Switzerland need health insurance when relocating?",
    answer: "Yes, all residents including students must have mandatory basic health insurance within 3 months of arrival. Student status doesn't exempt from this legal requirement. Some insurers offer student discounts. EU students may use European Health Insurance Card temporarily but must switch to Swiss insurance within the 3-month deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "How does accident coverage work if I'm employed in Switzerland during relocation?",
    answer: "If employed ≥8 hours/week, your employer provides mandatory UVG/LAA accident coverage, so exclude accident coverage from health insurance to save CHF 200-400/year. This applies once employment starts. Coordinate timing during relocation to avoid gaps or double coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't have health insurance in Switzerland after relocating?",
    answer: "Serious legal and financial consequences: Canton will automatically enroll you with an insurer and add penalty fees (up to 50% surcharge). You remain liable for all healthcare costs incurred without insurance. No retroactive coverage. Legal requirement means zero exceptions - secure insurance immediately upon arrival."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the key differences when relocating with a family versus as a single professional?",
    answer: "Family relocation involves additional considerations: schooling (international schools need 6-12 months lead time), childcare, larger accommodation needs, higher insurance costs (per family member), and family integration activities. Single professionals focus on career networking, proximity to work, and personal integration."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get a Swiss work permit during relocation?",
    answer: "Processing time varies significantly: EU/EFTA nationals get faster processing (weeks), non-EU/EFTA nationals require employer sponsorship and can take 2-4 months. Start applications 3-6 months before planned relocation. Complete documentation and employer support significantly speed up the process."

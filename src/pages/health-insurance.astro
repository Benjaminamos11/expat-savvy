const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is health insurance in Switzerland and why is it mandatory?",
    answer: "Health insurance in Switzerland (KVG/LAMal) is a legal requirement for all residents, including expats. The Swiss government mandates this to ensure everyone has access to quality healthcare. You must obtain coverage within 3 months of arrival, with coverage backdated to your arrival date. The system combines mandatory basic insurance that covers essential medical services with optional supplementary insurance for additional benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does health insurance cost in Switzerland for expats?",
    answer: "Health insurance premiums in Switzerland vary significantly by canton, age, and chosen options. In major cities like Zurich, Geneva, and Basel, expect to pay CHF 350-550 per month for basic coverage. Suburban areas typically cost CHF 300-450, while rural regions range from CHF 280-400. Factors affecting your premium include your deductible choice (CHF 300-2,500), insurance model (standard, HMO, family doctor, or telmed), and whether you need accident coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right health insurance in Switzerland?",
    answer: "The right health insurance depends on your specific needs and priorities. Consider these factors: English language support (Swica and Sanitas excel here), premium costs (compare providers like Assura or Atupri for competitive rates), service quality (CSS and Helsana offer comprehensive networks), and supplementary options (Groupe Mutuel excels here). Match the insurer's strengths with your priorities: language support, price, service quality, or additional coverage options."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I get cheaper health insurance in Switzerland?",
    answer: "To reduce your health insurance costs: 1) Choose a higher deductible - selecting CHF 2,500 instead of CHF 300 can save up to CHF 1,500 annually. 2) Select an alternative model - HMO, family doctor, or telmed models offer 10-25% discounts. 3) Exclude accident coverage if employed over 8 hours weekly, saving CHF 30-50 monthly. 4) Compare and switch providers annually during the November switching period. 5) Check if you qualify for cantonal premium subsidies (Pr√§mienverbilligung)."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need to apply for Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "To apply for health insurance in Switzerland, you'll need: your residence permit or application confirmation, valid passport, Swiss address registration, bank account details for premium payments, and employment contract if applicable. For supplementary insurance, you may need to complete a health questionnaire. EU/EFTA citizens should bring their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) if they have one, though it doesn't replace Swiss insurance."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Swiss health insurers reject my application?",
    answer: "For basic health insurance, no - insurers must accept all applicants regardless of age, health status, or pre-existing conditions. This is guaranteed by Swiss law. However, for supplementary insurance, insurers can reject applications, exclude pre-existing conditions, or charge higher premiums based on your health status. That's why it's advisable to apply for supplementary coverage when you're young and healthy."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't get health insurance within 3 months?",
    answer: "Missing the 3-month deadline has serious consequences. Your canton will automatically assign you to an insurer, often with higher premiums than if you'd chosen yourself. You'll still pay retroactively from your arrival date, potentially facing penalties and interest charges. The canton may also choose a low deductible option, resulting in higher monthly premiums. Additionally, you might face administrative fines for non-compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between basic and supplementary health insurance?",
    answer: "Basic insurance (KVG/LAMal) is mandatory and covers essential healthcare: doctor visits, hospital stays in general wards, prescribed medications, emergency care, maternity, and basic preventive care. Benefits are identical across all insurers. Supplementary insurance is optional and covers extras like private/semi-private hospital rooms, dental care, alternative medicine, gym memberships, worldwide coverage, and free choice of doctors in hospitals. Unlike basic insurance, insurers can reject supplementary applications."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right deductible for my situation?",
    answer: "Your deductible choice depends on expected healthcare usage. Choose CHF 300 if you have chronic conditions, expect surgery, or visit doctors frequently - you'll pay less out-of-pocket when you need care. Select CHF 2,500 if you're healthy and rarely need medical care - you'll save significantly on premiums. The break-even point is typically around CHF 1,900 in annual medical costs. Calculate your expected expenses and compare total costs (premiums plus out-of-pocket) for each option."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep my doctor when switching insurance providers?",
    answer: "With basic insurance and the standard model, yes - you can keep any doctor and switch insurers freely. However, if you choose a restricted model (HMO, family doctor, telmed), you must use designated providers or follow specific procedures. When switching from a restricted model to standard, you regain full freedom of choice. Always verify your preferred doctors are in-network before choosing a restricted model."
  },
  {
    question: "How does health insurance work for families in Switzerland?",
    answer: "In Switzerland, there's no family insurance - each family member needs individual coverage. Children (0-18) pay reduced premiums, young adults (19-25) pay moderate rates, and adults (26+) pay full premiums. Newborns must be insured within 3 months of birth, with coverage retroactive to birth date. For basic insurance, newborns are automatically accepted without health questions. Some insurers offer family discounts on supplementary insurance when multiple family members are insured."
  },
  {
    question: "What's covered by basic health insurance in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Basic health insurance covers: general practitioner and specialist visits, hospital treatment in general wards within your canton, emergency care throughout Switzerland and limited coverage abroad, prescribed medications on the official list, maternity care including prenatal checkups and delivery, some preventive measures like vaccinations, necessary medical aids and devices, and contributions to glasses/contacts for children. It doesn't cover dental care (except accidents), private hospital rooms, or most alternative therapies."

          "text": "For basic health insurance, no - insurers must accept all applicants regardless of age, health status, or pre-existing conditions. This is guaranteed by Swiss law. However, for supplementary insurance, insurers can reject applications, exclude pre-existing conditions, or charge higher premiums based on your health status. That's why it's advisable to apply for supplementary coverage when you're young and healthy."

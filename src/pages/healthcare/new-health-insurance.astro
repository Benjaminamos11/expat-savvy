const faqs = [
  {
    question: "When exactly does the 3-month deadline to get health insurance in Switzerland start?",
    answer: "The three-month Swiss health insurance deadline starts from the date you officially register your residence in Switzerland with the local authorities (Einwohnerkontrolle/Contrôle des habitants)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I miss the 3-month deadline for Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "If you fail to obtain health insurance within three months, the cantonal authorities can assign you to an insurer. You will likely have to pay premiums retroactively from your date of arrival, and you might face higher costs than if you had chosen a plan yourself."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose any doctor in Switzerland with basic health insurance?",
    answer: "This depends on the insurance model you choose for your basic health insurance. The Standard Model generally allows free choice of doctor. However, models like HMO, Family Doctor, or Telmed require you to first consult a designated doctor or use a specific network/hotline, except in emergencies."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Swiss health insurance if I'm only staying for 6 months?",
    answer: "Yes, health insurance in Switzerland is mandatory for all residents. Even for shorter stays, you are generally required to have Swiss health insurance. Some specific short-term visas or situations might have exceptions, but it's crucial to verify this with the authorities or an advisor."
  },
  {
    question: "Is dental care covered by basic Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "Basic health insurance (KVG/LAMal) generally does not cover routine dental care or orthodontic treatments. It may cover dental issues arising from serious, unavoidable diseases of the masticatory system or as a result of a severe accident. For regular dental check-ups, cleanings, fillings, etc., you would typically need supplementary dental insurance or pay out-of-pocket."

        <h2 id="understanding-swiss-insurance">Understanding Swiss Health Insurance: The Essentials for Newcomers</h2>
        
        <p>Switzerland prides itself on a healthcare system that is among the best in the world, offering high standards of medical care, state-of-the-art facilities, and a wide choice of medical professionals. However, this quality is supported by a structured system that requires participation from all residents, including expats. Understanding the fundamentals of Swiss health insurance requirements is key to making informed decisions and ensuring you are correctly and adequately covered from the moment you arrive.</p>
        
        <h3>Mandatory Basic Health Insurance (KVG/LAMal)</h3>
        
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 my-8">
          <p>The cornerstone of the Swiss healthcare framework is the mandatory basic health insurance, known as Grundversicherung in German, Assurance de base in French, and Assicurazione di base in Italian. This is governed by the Swiss Federal Health Insurance Act (KVG/LAMal). It is compulsory for every single person residing in Switzerland, regardless of their nationality, employment status, or age. This means that you, your partner, and your children must each have your own basic health insurance Switzerland policy.</p>
        
          <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-6">The 3-Month Deadline for Swiss Health Insurance:</h4>
          <p>This is a critical point for all health insurance Switzerland newcomers. Upon officially registering your residency in Switzerland, you have a strict three-month period to arrange your mandatory basic health insurance. It's important to understand that your coverage, and consequently your premium payments, will be backdated to your official date of arrival.</p>
          
          <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-yellow-800 m-0"><strong>Important:</strong> If you register on July 1st and finalize your insurance on September 15th, you will still need to pay premiums for July, August, and September. Missing this Swiss health insurance deadline can lead to complications: the cantonal authorities may assign you to an insurer automatically, potentially at a higher premium and not necessarily the best fit for your needs.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>Therefore, it is highly advisable to start researching and applying for your health insurance as soon as you arrive, or even before, if your arrival date is confirmed.</p>
        
          <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-6">Who Needs to Be Insured in Switzerland?</h4>
          <ul class="ml-6 space-y-1 list-disc">
            <li>Every individual residing in Switzerland</li>
            <li>Employed individuals</li>
            <li>Self-employed persons</li>
            <li>Students</li>
            <li>Children</li>
            <li>Non-working residents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each family member needs their own individual policy.</p>
        
          <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-6">Standardized Coverage under KVG/LAMal:</h4>
          <p>A key feature of the basic health insurance is that the scope of medical services covered is legally defined by the KVG/LAMal and is identical across all authorized health insurance companies (Krankenkassen). This means that whether you choose Insurer A or Insurer B, the fundamental benefits for illness, accident (unless covered by an employer's accident insurance), and maternity care will be the same when you set up health insurance Switzerland.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Key Swiss Health Insurance Terms You MUST Know</h3>
        
        <p>Getting to grips with Swiss health insurance for expats involves understanding some specific terminology. Here are the essential terms you'll encounter:</p>
        
        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-t-4 border-primary-500">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Premium</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">(Prämie/Prime/Premio)</p>
            <p>This is the non-negotiable monthly amount you pay to your health insurance company for your coverage. Premiums can vary based on your canton of residence, age, the specific insurer, and the insurance model you choose.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-t-4 border-primary-500">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Deductible</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">(Franchise/Franchigia)</p>
            <p>This is a fixed annual amount that you must pay out-of-pocket for your eligible medical expenses before your health insurance begins to cover costs. For adults, the ordinary minimum deductible is CHF 300 per year, with options up to CHF 2500. For children, a CHF 0 deductible is common.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-t-4 border-primary-500">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Co-payment/Retention Fee</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">(Selbstbehalt/Quote-part/Partecipazione ai costi)</p>
            <p>Once your medical expenses for the year have exceeded your annual deductible, you will still need to contribute 10% of the subsequent costs. There is an annual cap on this co-payment: CHF 700 for adults (with a CHF 300 deductible) and CHF 350 for children (with a CHF 0 deductible).</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-t-4 border-primary-500">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Accident Coverage</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">(Unfalldeckung/Couverture accidents/Copertura infortuni)</p>
            <p>Basic health insurance includes coverage for accidents. However, if you are employed in Switzerland for 8 hours or more per week with the same employer, you are automatically covered through your employer's accident insurance and can suspend this coverage from your basic health insurance.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Choosing Your Swiss Health Insurance Model</h3>
        
        <p>Swiss basic health insurance is not a one-size-fits-all product. Insurers offer several different models, which primarily differ in how you access medical care and, as a result, the cost of your monthly premiums. Selecting the right model for your health insurance Switzerland newcomers plan can lead to significant savings while still ensuring you receive the care you need.</p>

This differs significantly from basic insurance, where acceptance is guaranteed regardless of health status.</p>

          <p>Because of the health-based underwriting, it's wise to consider and apply for any desired supplementary insurance as early as possible, ideally when you are in good health. Waiting until a specific need arises might make it more difficult or impossible to get the coverage you want.</p>

        <p>Beyond the core aspects of choosing an insurance plan, there are a few other important points that health insurance Switzerland newcomers should keep in mind regarding their Swiss health insurance.</p>
        
        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 my-10">
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-500">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Already Have International Insurance?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Some expatriates arrive in Switzerland with existing international health insurance plans. While these might offer broad coverage, it is crucial to verify if they meet the specific requirements of the Swiss Federal Health Insurance Act (KVG/LAMal).</p>
            <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mt-4">
              <p class="text-yellow-800 m-0"><strong>Important:</strong> In most cases, you will still be required to take out a Swiss basic health insurance policy. Your international plan might serve as a supplementary cover, but it generally cannot replace the mandatory Swiss basic insurance.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">It's best to clarify this with the cantonal authorities or an expert advisor like Expat Savvy to ensure compliance and avoid any gaps in coverage or unexpected costs when dealing with expat health insurance Switzerland.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-l-4 border-primary-500">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Students, Researchers, and Short-Term Stays</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">If you are in Switzerland for studies, research, or other specific short-term purposes, there might be particular insurance arrangements or exemptions. For example, students from EU/EFTA countries with a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) might have certain coverages.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">However, for longer stays or to ensure comprehensive access to the Swiss healthcare system, obtaining local Swiss health insurance is usually necessary or highly recommended. We can help you understand the requirements based on your visa type and duration of stay.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-l-4 border-green-500">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Family Considerations</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">If you are moving to Switzerland with your family, each member, including children, must have their own basic health insurance Switzerland policy. Premiums for children are generally lower, and as mentioned, the co-payment cap for children is also lower (CHF 350 per year if they have a CHF 0 deductible).</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">Maternity care, including check-ups, delivery, and postnatal care, is covered by basic health insurance. When choosing a plan, consider the needs of your entire family, including proximity to pediatricians or specific medical facilities if required.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Language Barriers</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">While many healthcare professionals in larger Swiss cities speak English, official documentation and administrative processes related to health insurance in Switzerland are often in one of the national languages (German, French, or Italian).</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">Expat Savvy provides support in English throughout the entire process, from explaining policy documents to assisting with applications, ensuring that language barriers do not hinder your access to necessary healthcare information and services when you set up health insurance Switzerland.</p>

        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If you fail to obtain health insurance within three months, the cantonal authorities can assign you to an insurer. You will likely have to pay premiums retroactively from your date of arrival, and you might face higher costs than if you had chosen a plan yourself."

      "name": "Can I choose any doctor in Switzerland with basic health insurance?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This depends on the insurance model you choose for your basic health insurance. The Standard Model generally allows free choice of doctor. However, models like HMO, Family Doctor, or Telmed require you to first consult a designated doctor or use a specific network/hotline, except in emergencies."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, health insurance in Switzerland is mandatory for all residents. Even for shorter stays, you are generally required to have Swiss health insurance. Some specific short-term visas or situations might have exceptions, but it's crucial to verify this with the authorities or an advisor."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is dental care covered by basic Swiss health insurance?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Basic health insurance (KVG/LAMal) generally does not cover routine dental care or orthodontic treatments. It may cover dental issues arising from serious, unavoidable diseases of the masticatory system or as a result of a severe accident. For regular dental check-ups, cleanings, fillings, etc., you would typically need supplementary dental insurance or pay out-of-pocket."

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is it really worth changing my health insurance in Switzerland?",
    answer: "Yes, it often is. With annual premium increases (like the expected 6% average for 2025) and evolving personal needs, regularly reviewing and potentially switching your health insurance can lead to significant cost savings or securing better coverage that more accurately fits your current life situation."
  },
  {
    question: "When is the deadline to change or switch my basic health insurance?",
    answer: "The primary deadline to change or switch your basic Swiss health insurance (KVG/LAMal) is the end of November. You must ensure your written cancellation notice reaches your current insurer by registered mail by this date for the switch to be effective January 1st of the following year."
  },
  {
    question: "When can I change my health insurance if I miss the November deadline?",
    answer: "For basic health insurance, if you miss the end-of-November deadline, you generally have to wait until the next year to switch your provider. However, specific circumstances or changes to your policy might offer other opportunities. From 2025, it will be easier to change your basic insurance model within the same insurance company at different times."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my health insurance premium increase in Zurich or Geneva specifically?",
    answer: "Health insurance premiums are cantonal and can vary significantly. While there's a national average increase announced (e.g., 6% for 2025), the specific increase in cantons like Zurich or Geneva will be announced by the Federal Office of Public Health and individual insurers in autumn. Urban cantons often have higher premiums and can see notable increases."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch my health insurance if I am currently undergoing medical treatment?",
    answer: "For basic health insurance (KVG/LAMal), yes. Swiss law mandates that all insurers must accept any applicant for basic coverage, regardless of health status or ongoing treatments. For supplementary insurance (VVG/LCA), however, the new insurer can refuse your application or exclude pre-existing conditions."

              <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">The Quest for Cheaper Health Insurance</h4>
              <p class="text-gray-600">One of the most significant drivers for considering a health insurance switch in Switzerland is the persistent upward trend in premium costs. For 2025, forecasts indicate an average premium increase of around 6%. You might be wondering, "will premium increase in Zurich?" or "will premium increase in Geneva?" Yes, and in some cantons or with specific insurers, this figure could be even higher.</p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">This isn't an isolated event; it follows a pattern of rising healthcare expenditures and insurance costs that directly impact household budgets across the country. For many, this annual ritual of premium hikes means that the plan which was cost-effective last year might no longer be the most economical choice, prompting the search for cheaper health insurance Switzerland.</p>
              <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 my-4">
                <p class="text-yellow-800 m-0"><strong>Important:</strong> By comparing the new premium for your current plan against what other insurers offer for equivalent or even better health insurance coverage, you might find substantial annual savings, sometimes amounting to hundreds or even thousands of francs, depending on your family size and chosen coverage.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-600">Health insurance premiums vary considerably from one canton to another. If you move from a canton with lower average premiums to one with higher costs (e.g., Zurich or Geneva), your current insurance plan might become disproportionately expensive or no longer offer the best network in your new location. Changing to an insurer or model that is more competitive in your new canton of residence is often a smart move.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Understanding Annual Premium Increases</h3>
        
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-8">
          <p>It's an unfortunate but consistent reality: Swiss health insurance premiums tend to increase almost every year. Several factors contribute to this upward trend:</p>
          
          <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6">
            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-5 border-t-4 border-red-500">
              <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Rising Healthcare Costs</h4>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Advances in medical technology, an aging population, and increased utilization of healthcare services all contribute to higher overall healthcare expenditures, which insurers then pass on to policyholders through premiums.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-5 border-t-4 border-orange-500">
              <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Varying Cantonal Costs</h4>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Healthcare costs and, consequently, premiums differ significantly between cantons. For example, you might ask, "will premium increase in Zurich differently than in Bern?" The answer is often yes. Some regions consistently see higher average premiums due to local healthcare infrastructure and demographic factors.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-5 border-t-4 border-yellow-500">
              <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Insurer-Specific Adjustments</h4>
              <p class="text-gray-600">While there's an average national increase (e.g., around 6% forecasted for 2025), individual insurers may adjust their premiums differently based on their financial performance, risk pool, and operational costs. This means your specific insurer might announce a hike that is substantially higher or, occasionally, lower than the average.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 my-6">
            <p class="text-yellow-800 m-0"><strong>What this means for you:</strong> The premium you pay this year is not guaranteed for the next. Insurers typically announce their new premiums for the upcoming year in September or October. This is the critical period to assess how your premium will change and to start comparing it with offers from other providers if you are considering a health insurance switch. Ignoring these announcements can lead to unexpectedly higher bills come January.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">New Products and Evolving Insurance Models</h3>
        
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-8">
          <p>The Swiss health insurance market is not static. Insurers are continually developing new products and refining existing models to attract customers, manage costs, and cater to evolving consumer preferences. Keeping an eye on these developments can reveal opportunities for better health insurance or finding cheaper health insurance.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">The VVG/LCA (supplementary insurance) market is particularly dynamic. Insurers frequently launch new supplementary plans covering areas like more comprehensive dental care, broader coverage for alternative therapies, specific benefits for mental health and well-being, enhanced travel and international medical coverage, and contributions to fitness and preventative health measures.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">As mentioned, changes in Swiss law can also influence insurance products. The 2025 change allowing more flexibility in switching basic insurance models within the same company is one such example. Other regulatory shifts might affect benefit packages or how insurance is offered, impacting when can I change aspects of my plan.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-primary-50 border-l-4 border-primary-500 p-4 mt-6">
            <p class="text-primary-800 m-0"><strong>Why this matters for switching:</strong> A new product or model might offer a better fit for your current needs or budget than what was available when you last chose your plan. For example, a new Telmed model might offer a significantly lower premium that suits your preference for initial remote consultations. Or a new supplementary dental plan might provide the exact coverage your family now needs at a competitive price. Expat Savvy stays abreast of these new product launches and market shifts, ensuring that the comparisons we provide include the latest and most relevant options for you when you decide to switch insurance.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="mt-6">
            <p>Being aware of these market dynamics – the inevitability of premium increases and the constant emergence of new solutions – underscores the importance of annually reviewing your health insurance. It's not just about reacting to a price hike; it's about proactively ensuring your coverage remains optimal in an ever-changing landscape.</p>

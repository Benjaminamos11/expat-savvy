        <p>
          Before exploring Sympany's specific plans, it's important for expats to understand the Swiss health insurance framework. The system is built on two core pillars: compulsory basic health insurance (LAMal/KVG – Sympany LAMal KVG) and optional supplementary insurance (LCA/VVG – Sympany LCA VVG). Sympany provides comprehensive solutions under both categories, ensuring you meet legal requirements while offering the flexibility to tailor coverage to your personal healthcare preferences with a clear focus on value and simplicity.

            The Swiss Health Insurance System (Compulsory Basic - LAMal/KVG)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Every resident in Switzerland, including expats, must secure basic health insurance within three months of arrival. Mandated by the Federal Health Insurance Act (LAMal or KVG), this insurance guarantees access to essential medical services. The benefits are legally defined and uniform across all insurers, including Sympany. This foundational coverage includes treatments for illness, accidents (if not covered by an employer's accident insurance), and maternity care.

            Supplementary Insurance (Optional - LCA/VVG)
          </h3>
          <p>
            While basic insurance covers essential needs, many expats opt for supplementary insurance to enhance their protection and access a wider range of services. These plans, governed by the Federal Insurance Contracts Act (LCA or VVG), vary in benefits and premiums. Sympany's supplementary health insurance options can include private or semi-private hospital rooms, comprehensive dental care, alternative medicine, and extensive international travel coverage – all valuable additions for the expat lifestyle.

            <span><strong>Important note:</strong> Unlike basic insurance, insurers are not obligated to accept everyone for supplementary coverage. It's advisable to apply when you're in good health, as medical underwriting is typically required. Also, while basic insurance can be changed annually, supplementary insurance often involves longer commitments.</span>

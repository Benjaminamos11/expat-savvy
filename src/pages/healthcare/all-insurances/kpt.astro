Check the KPT website for the most up-to-date information on their digital capabilities."

    question: "How does KPT compare to other health insurance providers in Switzerland for expats?",
    answer: "When comparing insurers, consider: premiums for your specific coverage needs, coverage scope for your health requirements, network access if using a managed care model, availability of service in your preferred language, and provider reputation. An independent insurance advisor can help with personalized comparisons."

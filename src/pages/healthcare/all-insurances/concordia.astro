        <p>
          Before exploring Concordia's specific plans, it's crucial for expats and families to understand the Swiss health insurance framework. The system is built on two main pillars: compulsory basic health insurance (governed by Concordia LAMal KVG) and optional supplementary insurance (governed by Concordia LCA VVG). Concordia provides comprehensive solutions under both categories, ensuring you can meet legal requirements while tailoring coverage to your personal healthcare preferences.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 my-8 border-l-4 border-primary-500">

            Why is Concordia known as "the family insurance"?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Concordia has earned its reputation as "the family insurance" through its family-centric approach to health coverage. They offer attractive premiums for children, comprehensive family plans, and services that address the unique healthcare needs of families at different life stages. Their focus on preventive care, robust dental options, and personalized service makes them particularly appealing to families looking for reliable healthcare protection.

            The Swiss Health Insurance System (Compulsory Basic - LAMal/KVG)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Every resident in Switzerland, including expats and their family members, must have basic health insurance within three months of arrival. This insurance, mandated by the Federal Health Insurance Act (LAMal or KVG), ensures access to essential medical services. The benefits are legally defined and identical across all insurers, including Concordia. This foundational coverage includes treatments for illness, accidents (if not covered by an employer's accident insurance), and maternity care, guaranteeing a high standard of healthcare for everyone.

            Supplementary Insurance (Optional - LCA/VVG)
          </h3>
          <p>
            While basic insurance provides essential coverage, many expats and families opt for supplementary insurance to enhance their protection and comfort. These plans, offered under the Federal Insurance Contracts Act (LCA or VVG), are not standardized, meaning benefits and premiums vary. Concordia's supplementary health insurance options allow you to cover services such as private or semi-private hospital rooms, comprehensive dental treatments, alternative medicine, and more extensive international coverage – all aspects that are often highly valued by the international community and families in Switzerland.

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "When do I need to get Swiss health insurance?",
    answer: "You must obtain Swiss health insurance within 3 months of arriving in Switzerland. The coverage is retroactive to your arrival date. If you don't arrange insurance within this period, authorities may assign you to an insurance provider and you may face penalties.",
    link: {
      text: "Learn more about health insurance for new arrivals",
      url: "/guides/how-to/health-insurance-new-arrivals"
    }
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose any insurance provider?",
    answer: "Yes, you can choose any insurance provider in Switzerland for your basic insurance. The coverage is identical across all insurers as it's regulated by law. What differs are the premium costs, service quality, and available insurance models.",
    link: null
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my insurance provider?",
    answer: "Yes, you can switch basic insurance providers twice a year: by November 30 to change from January 1, or by March 31 to change from July 1. You must have paid all outstanding premiums, and your current deductible doesn't transfer to the new insurer.",
    link: {
      text: "How to change your health insurance provider",
      url: "/guides/how-to/change-health-insurance"
    }
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need supplementary insurance?",
    answer: "Supplementary insurance is optional and covers services beyond the basic insurance package. Whether you need it depends on your personal preferences and health needs. Common supplementary options include dental care, private hospital rooms, and expanded alternative medicine coverage.",
    link: {
      text: "Learn about supplementary insurance options",
      url: "/healthcare/supplementary-insurance"
    }
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't pay my premiums?",
    answer: "If you don't pay your premiums, your insurer will send reminders followed by debt collection procedures. Eventually, the canton may list you in a registry of defaulters. While insurers cannot terminate your basic coverage, they can restrict you to emergency treatment only until outstanding payments are resolved.",
    link: null
  },
  {
    question: "How does basic health insurance work for cross-border commuters?",
    answer: "Cross-border commuters working in Switzerland generally have the right to choose whether to be insured in Switzerland or their country of residence (if it's an EU/EFTA state). The decision depends on your specific situation, residency status, and other factors. Once you make your choice, you need to formally request an exemption from the mandatory Swiss insurance if you choose to be insured in your country of residence.",
    link: {
      text: "Cross-border insurance information",
      url: "/insurance-guides/cross-border-insurance"
    }
  },
  {
    question: "Are pre-existing conditions covered?",
    answer: "Yes, basic health insurance must cover pre-existing conditions. Unlike in some countries, Swiss insurers cannot refuse coverage or charge higher premiums for basic insurance based on your health status or medical history.",
    link: null
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need treatment while temporarily abroad?",
    answer: "For emergency medical treatment during a temporary stay abroad (e.g., on vacation), basic insurance covers costs up to twice the amount that the same treatment would cost in Switzerland. For EU/EFTA countries, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), usually on the back of your Swiss insurance card, facilitates access to necessary medical care under the same conditions and at the same cost as people insured in that country.",

              Basic health insurance (KVG/LAMal) is <strong>mandatory for everyone living in Switzerland</strong>. This requirement ensures that all residents have access to high-quality healthcare without facing excessive financial burdens.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
              The beauty of the Swiss system lies in its standardized benefits: the core services you receive are identical regardless of which insurance company you choose. What differs are the service quality, premium costs, and available insurance models.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
              For newcomers to Switzerland, you have a <strong>three-month window</strong> to secure your basic health insurance after registering as a resident. Coverage is retroactive to your arrival date, so any medical expenses during this period will be covered once you've enrolled.

            Swiss basic health insurance provides a comprehensive package of essential medical services. These benefits are standardized across all insurers, ensuring equal access to necessary care for all residents.

            Here's a closer look at what's included in the basic insurance package (KVG/LAMal):

              This encompasses visits to general practitioners (GPs) and specialists (though specialist access might require a referral depending on your chosen insurance model). It also covers hospital stays in a general ward within your canton of residence.

            <p class="text-gray-600">
              <strong>Emergency treatments</strong> are covered worldwide, although there are limitations—typically up to double the cost of what the same treatment would cost in your canton of residence.

If you prefer flexibility and direct specialist access, the Standard model may be worth the higher premium. If you don't mind having a primary contact point, alternative models can save you 15-25% on premiums.

          <p>
            In the Swiss healthcare system, your costs consist of three main components: monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and co-payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your <strong>deductible (franchise)</strong> is the amount you pay for medical expenses before insurance coverage begins. Higher deductibles mean lower monthly premiums but higher initial out-of-pocket costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            After meeting your deductible, you pay a <strong>co-payment (Selbstbehalt)</strong> of 10% of costs up to an annual maximum of CHF 700 for adults and CHF 350 for children.

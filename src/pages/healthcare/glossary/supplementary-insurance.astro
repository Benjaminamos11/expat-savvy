        <h2>Types of Supplementary Insurance</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>General ward (allgemeine Abteilung):</strong> Basic insurance already covers this, but supplementary insurance may provide additional benefits even in general wards</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-private (halbprivat):</strong> Accommodations in 2-bed rooms and treatment by senior physicians</li>
          <li><strong>Private (privat):</strong> Single-room accommodations and treatment by chief physicians</li>
        </ul>

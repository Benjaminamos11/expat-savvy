          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Hey there! I'm Benjamin, and if you're reading this, chances are you're either planning a move to Switzerland or you've recently arrived and are trying to make sense of it all. Believe me, I get it. More than you might think.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            For years, I've lived what many call a 'digital nomad' lifestyle. I've packed my bags and landed in more new countries than I can count on both hands – each with its own unique charm, its own set of rules, and yes, its own bewildering bureaucracy. It's not always the straightforward 'expat' assignment; often it's been about diving headfirst into the unknown, figuring things out as I go. That feeling of being 'new,' where everything from the language on the street signs to the way you buy a train ticket is an adventure (and sometimes a challenge!), is something I know intimately.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-10">
            And through all these travels and transitions, one thing became crystal clear: when you're trying to build a life or even just settle in for a while, the last thing you want to be bogged down by is confusing paperwork and systems you don't understand. Especially when it comes to something as vital as your health and security.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Expat Savvy? Because Helping Feels Good.</h3>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            With over 20 years of experience as an insurance consultant, I've seen the ins and outs of the industry. I've seen how complex it can be, but also how crucial the right protection is. When I started focusing more on Switzerland, a country I deeply admire for its quality of life and stunning beauty, I saw a gap. So many international folks were arriving, full of hope and excitement, only to hit a wall of confusion when it came to Swiss insurance.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            I wanted to change that. Honestly? Because nothing gives back more than genuinely helping someone navigate a tricky situation and seeing that look of relief on their face. It's about taking that burden off your shoulders so you can actually enjoy the incredible experience of living in Switzerland.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-10">
            Expat Savvy was born from this desire: to be that down-to-earth, straightforward guide for expats and global minds. We're not about stuffy corporate talk or pushing products. We're about listening to your story, understanding your needs, and finding the simplest, clearest path to getting you properly set up and feeling secure. We're here to translate the complex into the understandable, to be your friendly advisors who've got your back.

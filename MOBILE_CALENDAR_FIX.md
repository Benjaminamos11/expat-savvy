# Mobile Calendar Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue
On mobile devices, the Cal.com calendar embedded in modals was displaying in desktop mode, making it very difficult to fill out on small screens.

## Solution
Implemented mobile detection that opens Cal.com in a new tab on mobile devices instead of embedding it in the modal. This provides a much better user experience on mobile.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Modal Files
Modified all modal files to detect mobile devices and handle calendar booking differently:

**Files Updated:**
- `public/final-modal.html` - Health insurance modal
- `public/relocation-modal.html` - Relocation services modal
- `public/life-pension-modal.html` - Life & pension modal
- `public/other-insurance-modal.html` - Other insurance modal

**Changes in Each File:**
- Added mobile detection: `const isMobile = /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) || window.innerWidth < 768;`
- Modified `renderStep4()` function to:
  - On mobile: Show a button that opens Cal.com in a new tab
  - On desktop: Continue showing the iframe embed as before
- Auto-opens the calendar in a new tab when mobile users reach the booking step
- Shows a mobile-friendly interface with a clear "Open Calendar to Book" button

### 2. Updated Modal Overlay System
Modified `public/scripts/modal-overlay-system.js` to handle mobile detection in the manual calendar initialization function:

**Changes:**
- Added mobile detection in `initializeCalComManually()` function
- On mobile: Opens Cal.com in new tab and shows a message
- On desktop: Continues with normal iframe/API embed
- Prefills user data (name, email, phone) in both mobile and desktop modes

## Mobile Experience

### What Mobile Users See:
1. **Nice Icon**: Red calendar icon in a circular background
2. **Clear Heading**: "Book Your Consultation"
3. **Explanation**: "For the best booking experience on mobile, we'll open the calendar in a new tab."
4. **Primary Button**: Large "Open Calendar to Book" button with external link icon
5. **Benefits List**: Shows what they'll get (free consultation, video/phone call, easy to reschedule)
6. **Auto-Open**: Calendar automatically opens in new tab when they reach this step

### Desktop Experience:
- **No Changes**: Desktop users continue to see the calendar embedded directly in the modal
- Works exactly as before with smooth iframe integration

## Benefits

✅ **Better Mobile UX**: Native Cal.com mobile interface instead of cramped desktop view  
✅ **Prefilled Data**: User information carries over to new tab  
✅ **Clear Communication**: Users understand why calendar opens in new tab  
✅ **Easy Re-access**: Button to reopen calendar if they close the tab  
✅ **No Desktop Impact**: Desktop experience unchanged  
✅ **Consistent Branding**: Maintains red color scheme and design language  

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Testing**: 
   - Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - Test on different screen sizes (< 768px width)
   - Verify auto-open works and button is clickable

2. **Desktop Testing**:
   - Verify calendar still embeds properly in modal
   - Test on different desktop screen sizes
   - Verify no regressions in booking flow

3. **Cross-Browser**:
   - Safari (iOS)
   - Chrome (Android)
   - Firefox Mobile
   - Samsung Internet

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Issue Found:**
The image you showed was from a provider page (`/providers/assura.astro`) that uses `ConsultationModal`, which was **only submitting to Formspree** and **not triggering the email nurture sequence**.

### **Fix Applied:**
Modified `src/components/ConsultationModal.astro` to:
1. ✅ Submit to backend API first (`https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead`)
2. ✅ Send welcome email immediately
3. ✅ Keep Formspree as backup/fallback
4. ✅ Maintain all existing functionality

### **Code Added:**
```javascript
// Send data to backend API for email nurture
const leadData = {
  name: userData.name,
  email: userData.email,
  phone: userData.phone || '',
  consent_marketing: true,
  stage: 'new',
  flow: 'consultation',
  notes: {
    form_type: 'consultation_modal',
    topic: userData.topic,
    source: userData.source,
    notes: userData.notes,
    insurance_type: userData.insuranceType,
    provider_name: userData.providerName,
    page_url: currentPageUrl,
    page_title: pageTitle
  }
};

// Submit to backend API for email nurture
fetch('https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(leadData)
})
```

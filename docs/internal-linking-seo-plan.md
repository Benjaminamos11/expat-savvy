# Internal Linking and SEO Enhancement Plan for Expat Savvy

This plan outlines targeted improvements to enhance internal linking, search engine optimization, and LLM compatibility without major design or content restructuring.

## 1. Internal Linking Strategy

### A. Topic Clusters Approach
1. **Core Topic Pages**
   - Identify primary topics: Health Insurance, Relocation, Pension Planning, etc.
   - Ensure each core topic page links to all relevant subtopic pages
   - Example: Health Insurance page should link to all insurance models, provider comparisons, etc.

2. **Pillar-Cluster Implementation**
   - Create or enhance "pillar" content for each main topic area
   - Link all related "cluster" content back to the pillar page
   - Ensure bidirectional linking between related cluster content

### B. Cross-Linking Between Related Content
1. **Related Content Sections**
   - Add a "Related Articles" section at the end of each blog post
   - Link to 3-5 topically relevant articles, prioritizing:
     - High-value content that needs more internal links
     - Content that naturally extends the current topic
     - Converting paths (links to consultation, provider pages)

2. **Contextual Linking**
   - Add natural, contextual links within body content
   - Use descriptive anchor text with target keywords
   - Focus on pages that align with the user's likely next question

### C. Glossary Terms Enhancement
1. **Link Common Insurance Terms**
   - Identify key terms repeatedly used across content
   - Link first instance of each term to corresponding glossary entry
   - Create a script to semi-automate this process

2. **Embed Mini-Glossaries**
   - Add mini-glossary sections to complex articles
   - Include 3-5 relevant terms with brief definitions
   - Link each term to its full glossary page

## 2. Search Optimization Enhancements

### A. Title and Heading Optimization
1. **Question-Based Headings**
   - Convert informational headings to natural questions
   - Ensure H1, H2, H3 structure addresses user search intent
   - Example: Change "Supplementary Insurance" to "What is Supplementary Insurance?"

2. **Featured Snippet Targeting**
   - Structure content blocks to win featured snippets
   - Use clear definitions, numbered steps, and concise tables
   - Add "definition blocks" for key terms with summary statements

   - Add BreadcrumbList schema to all pages
   - Implement HowTo schema for all process/guide content
   - Add Table schema for comparison tables

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Add descriptive alt text to all images
   - Ensure proper image dimensions and sizing
   - Implement lazy loading for all non-critical images

   - Use consistent naming and include alternative names/spellings
   - Reference entities consistently across content

2. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Clarify relationships between entities
   - Create "relation blocks" explaining how concepts interconnect

### C. LLM-Friendly Formatting

2. **Fact-Based Writing**

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (TODAY)

#### 1.1 Fix Future Date Issue
- [ ] Update `src/pages/healthcare/glossary/basic-health-insurance.astro` Line 5
- [ ] Change "July 15, 2025" ‚Üí "June 1, 2025"

#### 1.2 Fix JSON Visibility in Blog Posts  
**Root Cause**: Markdown files can't properly render Astro components
**Solution Options**:
- A) Remove breadcrumb schema from markdown files temporarily
- B) Convert critical blog posts to `.astro` format  
- C) Use HTML breadcrumbs in markdown instead

**Recommended**: Option A (Remove temporarily, re-implement properly later)

#### 1.3 Investigate Image Loading Issues
- [ ] Check if image URLs are broken
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary links are working
- [ ] Test image loading on affected pages

### Phase 2: Systematic Date Updates (THIS WEEK)

3. Update to appropriate June 2025 dates
4. Test build
5. Check page rendering
6. Commit individual file changes

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (ONGOING)

- [ ] All dates are consistent and realistic
- [ ] No JSON/schema code visible as text
- [ ] All images loading properly
- [ ] All internal links working
- [ ] No broken components

- Centralize date constants
- Regular date audits
- Clear date update procedures

### 3. Component Testing
- Test Astro components in both `.astro` and `.md` contexts

## üìù LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Bulk changes are risky** - Page-by-page is safer
2. **Test components in all contexts** - Astro vs Markdown behave differently  
3. **Date management needs system** - Manual updates are error-prone
4. **User feedback is crucial** - Issues not caught in testing

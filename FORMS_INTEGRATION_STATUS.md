## 🎯 Main Form: "Get 3 Offers" Modal

**File:** `public/scripts/offers-modal.js`
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY INTEGRATED**

### Integration Details:
- **Backend API Call:** Line 1370
- **Endpoint:** `POST https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead`
- **Triggers:** Welcome email sent immediately upon form submission
- **Data Captured:**
  - Name, email, phone
  - Attribution data (UTM parameters, referrer, landing path)
  - Form preferences (postcode, household, motivation, deductible, model)
  - Page context and intent

### Code Snippet:
```javascript
async submitToBackendAPI() {
    const leadData = {
      name: this.formData.name || '',
      email: this.formData.email || '',
      phone: this.formData.phone || '',
      consent_marketing: this.formData.consent || true,
      stage: 'new',
      flow: 'quote',
      // ... attribution and form data
    };

    const response = await fetch('https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(leadData)
    });
}
```

### Where it's Used:
- ✅ Homepage
- ✅ All insurance provider pages
- ✅ City-specific pages (Zurich, Geneva, Basel, etc.)
- ✅ Setup/Change flows

## 🔍 Form Trigger Buttons

The "Get 3 Offers" modal is triggered by multiple buttons across the site:

### 1. **Hero CTA Buttons**
- Class: `.cta-button`, `.get-offers-btn`
- Locations: Homepage hero, provider pages

### 2. **Sticky Header Button**
- ID: `#get-offers-btn`
- Always visible for easy access

### 3. **In-Content CTAs**
- Various "Get Quotes" buttons throughout content

### 4. **Mobile-Specific Triggers**
- Optimized for mobile with `data-opens-offers-modal`

All these buttons open the same modal, which is connected to the backend API.

## 📱 Consultation Form (Direct Booking)

**Status:** ✅ **INTEGRATED** (within offers modal)

This is part of the offers modal flow where users can choose to:
1. **Option A:** Get 3 offers (fills form → sends to backend)
2. **Option B:** Schedule consultation (redirects to Cal.com)

Both paths are tracked:
- Option A → Creates lead → Starts email sequence
- Option B → Direct to Cal.com → Webhook stops any existing sequence

---

## 🏢 Insurance Provider Pages

**Status:** ✅ **ALL CONNECTED**

All insurance provider pages (Assura, Sanitas, Swica, CSS, Helsana, etc.) use the same "Get 3 Offers" modal system.

### No Inline Forms Found
After thorough search, **no separate inline forms** were found on insurance provider pages. All lead capture goes through the unified modal system.

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests:

- [x] Homepage - "Get 3 Offers" button
- [x] Welcome email delivery
- [x] Backend API lead creation
- [x] Cal.com webhook integration
- [x] Email sequence stopping on booking

## 🔄 How It Works (Complete Flow)

```
User clicks "Get 3 Offers" → Modal opens
         ↓
User fills form (6 steps) → Submit
         ↓
Form calls submitToBackendAPI() → POST to /api/lead
         ↓
Backend API receives data → Creates lead in Supabase
         ↓
Welcome email sent via Resend → Email arrives in inbox
         ↓
Lead tracked with email_sequence_status = 'active'
         ↓
[24 hours later] → Cron job checks → Sends Day 1 email (if no booking)
         ↓
[72 hours later] → Cron job checks → Sends Day 3 email (if no booking)
         ↓
[User books anytime] → Cal.com webhook → Stops email sequence
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. **No Old Forms to Update**
✅ No legacy inline forms found
✅ All forms use the unified modal system
✅ No additional integration needed

### 2. **Form Evolution**
The site previously may have had inline forms, but the current codebase uses:
- **Single modal system** (`offers-modal.js`)
- **Centralized API integration** (one backend call for all forms)
- **Consistent data structure** (all forms send same lead format)

### 3. **Attribution Tracking**
All forms automatically capture:
- UTM parameters
- Referrer
- Landing page
- Channel (organic, paid, etc.)
- City/location

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### If You Add New Forms:

1. **Use the existing modal** (recommended)
   ```javascript
   // Trigger existing modal
   document.getElementById('get-offers-btn').click();
   ```

2. **Or create new form** (if needed)
   ```javascript
   // Must call the backend API
   fetch('https://expat-savvy-api.fly.dev/api/lead', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       name: '...',
       email: '...',
       stage: 'new',
       flow: 'quote',
       // ... other required fields
     })
   });
   ```

### Required Fields for New Forms:
```json
{
  "name": "string (required)",
  "email": "string (required, must be valid email)",
  "phone": "string (optional)",
  "consent_marketing": "boolean (required)",
  "stage": "string (default: 'new')",
  "flow": "string (default: 'quote')"
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring Form Submissions

-- Recent form submissions
SELECT

  name,
  email,
  flow,
  email_welcome_sent_at,
  email_sequence_status
FROM leads 
WHERE flow = 'quote'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;
```

### Check in Fly.io Logs:
```bash
fly logs | grep "lead_created\|Welcome email"
```
